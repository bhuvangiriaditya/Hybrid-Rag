<div class='section'><h2>Custom Metrics Justification</h2>
<h3>Answer F1</h3>
<p><b>Why chosen:</b> Measures overlap between generated answers and ground truth while allowing partial credit. Useful for open-ended answers.</p>
<p><b>Calculation:</b> precision = |overlap|/|pred|, recall = |overlap|/|gt|, F1 = 2·precision·recall/(precision+recall).</p>
<p><b>Interpretation:</b> Higher is better; 1.0 is perfect lexical match.</p>
<h3>Contextual Precision</h3>
<p><b>Why chosen:</b> Measures grounding by checking how much of the answer appears in retrieved context, indicating faithfulness.</p>
<p><b>Calculation:</b> CP = |answer tokens ∩ context tokens| / |answer tokens|.</p>
<p><b>Interpretation:</b> Higher is better; low values suggest hallucination risk.</p>
