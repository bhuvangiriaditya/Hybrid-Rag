The aim of its creation was to collect and present relevant material from that time period. The genesis of the book collection dates from the 1970s. The bibliophilic interests of Konstantinos Staikos changed radically. In those years also, the Hellenic Bibliophile Society was established [3] under the Honorary Presidency of Constantinos Tsatsos. The exhibitions of books of the Society (1975) with travellers' accounts: 'Travellers in Greece from the fifteenth century to 1821', or with printed material regarding the chronicle of Greek typography: 'Outset of Greek typography' (1976) radically altered Konstantinos Staikos interests as collector and from then on he consciously turned to the study and research of the pioneers of Greek printing and the relations they cultivated with the world of books in Venice and elsewhere. His acquaintance with Georgios Ladas, who was profoundly conscious of the role played by printed books during the Ottoman domination and who collected and documented the bibliographic identity of an enormous number of books that came into his hands, empowered Konstantinos Staikos' intention to explore the chronicle of Greek typography in greater depth. The initial approach was to record printers' marks and emblems characterizing printed Greek books, resulting in the planning of the Charta of Greek Printing. At the same time the collection began to take shape, with the purchase of books entirely compatible with the terms regulating the Hellenic Bibliography as recorded by \u00c9. Legrand, printed material, that is to say, testifying to the pains and labours of the printing workshops. From 1986 the most representative body of the Konstantinos Staikos collection, covering the works and the days of Greek scholars and printers active in the period of the Italian Renaissance (late fourteenth \u2013 mid-sixteenth centuries) became the object of exhibitions for the promotion of their work. First editions by Manuel Chrysoloras, George of Trebizond, Cardinal Bessarion, Theodoros Gazis, Zacharias Kallierges, Nikolaos Vlastos and numerous others were presented successively in Florence (1986); the Benaki Museum (1987); Geneva University (1988); Strasburg (1989) and elsewhere. These exhibitions were accompanied by detailed bilingual catalogues, compiled in collaboration with M.I. Manoussakas, with introductory notes and extensive commentaries for each book. The ultimate goal of these exhibitions was the promotion of the inestimable and decisive contribution of the Greek scholars of the period to the diffusion of Greek letters and to demonstrate: the relations they cultivated with the supreme Humanists of Italy, many of whom had been their pupils. Examples from the collection were exhibited at the Hellenic Institute of Byzantine and Post-Byzantine Studies in Venice in 1993, with landmark editions by Aldus Manutius, the products of literary editors by renowned Greek scholars such as Marcus Musurus and Ioannes Gregoropoulos. In Austria, at Vienna's Imperial Library nearly all the Greek books published/printed there (1749\u20131800) were exhibited, which were the most significant examples of the Neohellenic Enlightenment. In celebration of the Five Hundred Years since the establishment of the first Greek printing press (Venice 1499), the Greek Parliament Foundation assigned to Triantafyllos Sklavenitis and Konstantinos Staikos the organization of an exhibition of the most important material of the whole period: a considerable number of incunables and printed material deriving for the greater part from his library. In 2010 the Collection was acquired by the Onassis Foundation in order to be preserved as perpetual property of the Greek Nation.",

        "text": "Robots is a 2005 American animated science fiction comedy film directed by Chris Wedge and written by David Lindsay-Abaire, Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. Produced by 20th Century Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios, it stars the voices of Ewan McGregor, Halle Berry, Greg Kinnear, Mel Brooks, Amanda Bynes, Drew Carey and Robin Williams. The story follows an ambitious inventor robot named Rodney Copperbottom, who seeks to work for his idol Bigweld's company in Robot City, but discovers a plot by its new leader Phineas T. Ratchet and his mother to forcibly upgrade the city's populace and eradicate struggling robots, known as \"outmodes\". Development of the film began in 2000, following a failed attempt by Wedge and children's author William Joyce to adapt Joyce's 1993 children's book Santa Calls. They instead decided to create an original story based on robots. The project was approved by executive producer Chris Meledandri in 2001 and production began the next year. Robots premiered at the Mann Village Theatre in Westwood, Los Angeles, on March 6, 2005, and was released in the United States on March 11 by 20th Century Fox. The film was praised by critics for its humor, animation, and performances, while its story and characters were deemed somewhat formulaic.[4] The film was commercially successful, grossing $262.5 million worldwide against a $75\u201380 million budget. A sequel was discussed but never produced due to the studio shifting focus to its flagship franchise, Ice Age.[5] In a world of robots, Rodney Copperbottom, son of Herb and Lydia Copperbottom, is an aspiring young inventor from the city of Rivet Town. He idolizes Bigweld, a famous inventor and philanthropist whose company, Bigweld Industries, employs other inventors and provides poor robots with spare parts. Rodney develops a small, flying robot named Wonderbot to assist his father, who works as a dishwasher in a restaurant. When Herb's boss, Mr. Gunk, confronts them, however, Wonderbot malfunctions and wreaks havoc in the kitchen. To help Herb pay for the damages, Rodney travels to Robot City, hoping to present Wonderbot to Bigweld Industries. However, upon his arrival, Rodney is ejected from Bigweld Industries by its new CEO, Phineas T. Ratchet. In Bigweld's absence, Ratchet has discontinued production of spare parts and inventions for the poor outmoded robots, prioritizing expensive \"upgrades\". Meanwhile, Ratchet's mother Madame Gasket runs the Chop Shop, a facility that recycles scrap metal, including that of deceased or outmoded robots, into ingots for upgrades. Rodney befriends Fender Pinwheeler, a ne'er-do-well who introduces him to a group of outmoded robots known as the \"Rusties\". Rodney and his new friends help to fix outmodes throughout the neighborhood, but they are eventually unable to cope with the demand due to the spare part shortage. Hoping to enlist Bigweld's help, Rodney and Fender infiltrate the Bigweld Ball, but Ratchet announces that Bigweld will not attend. An enraged Rodney confronts Ratchet, who orders his security team to eliminate him. Cappy, an executive opposed to Ratchet, rescues Rodney and Fender. While Fender is captured by the Chop Shop, he discovers their plan to scrap all outmoded robots with new machines designed to destroy them. Rodney and Cappy fly to Bigweld's mansion, where he lives as a recluse and reveals that Ratchet's greed led to his resignation and refuses to help them. A distraught Rodney calls his parents, but Herb inspires him to fight for his dreams. Fender escapes the Chop Shop and exposes Ratchet's plot. Rodney rallies the Rusties, and Bigweld, reinvigorated by Rodney's spirit, joins them to stop Ratchet. Rodney and his friends return to Bigweld Industries where Ratchet attempts to dispose of Bigweld, who ends up being rolled into the Chop Shop. Rodney upgrades the Rusties and leads them in a battle against Ratchet, Gasket, and their army. Gasket is eventually flung into the incinerator and destroyed, and Ratchet is stripped of his upgrades and left chained with his father. Retaking control of Bigweld Industries, Bigweld holds a public ceremony in Rivet Town, where he nominates Rodney as his new second-in-command and eventual successor. Rodney provides Herb with new replacement parts and a flugelhorn-like instrument to fulfill his life-long dream of being a musician. Herb leads the townspeople in a rendition of \"Get Up Offa That Thing\". Initially, Chris Wedge and William Joyce wanted to make a film adaptation of Joyce's 1993 book Santa Calls. After a failed animation test in 2000 (which resulted in 20th Century Fox Animation declining to make the film), Wedge and Joyce decided to instead develop an original story about a world of robots. In 2001, the duo pitched the concept to 20th Century Fox Animation president Chris Meledandri, as a visual idea. Although not initially impressed, Meledandri agreed to greenlight the film and served as its executive producer.[11] The film began production in 2002, shortly after Ice Age was released. Wedge reunited with the crew from his first film, including Carlos Saldanha as the co-director. In June 2003, the film was announced by Fox at the American Museum of Natural History's IMAX theater. This announcement confirmed the entire cast and slated the film for its 2005 release.[12] Robots was originally scheduled for a 2004 release,[13] but the release date was changed to 2005. The film had its world premiere on March 6, 2005, in Westwood, Los Angeles,[6][7] and it was released theatrically on March 11, 2005. The film was the first to feature the new trailer for Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith;[14] it was reported that Star Wars fans went to see the movie just to see the trailer and hear the voice of Ewan McGregor, who also played Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars prequel trilogy, as Rodney Copperbottom. The film also featured the exclusive trailer for Blue Sky's next film Ice Age: The Meltdown, then called Ice Age 2.[15] Robots was digitally re-mastered into IMAX format (IMAX DMR) and released in select IMAX theaters around the world. It was the first 20th Century Fox film that was released on the same day on IMAX and conventional 35mm screens. It was also the first IMAX DMR film released in the spring season, and the second IMAX DMR film distributed by Fox.[16] The film was released on DVD and VHS in both fullscreen and widescreen on September 27, 2005.[17] The DVD release was accompanied by an original short animated film based on Robots, titled Aunt Fanny's Tour of Booty.[18][19] The short is a prequel to the film, as it takes place during Fender's arrival in Robot City. In the short, Aunt Fanny gives a tour of the Robot City Train Station to a motley collection of robots, including Fender Pinwheeler, Zinc, Tammy, Hacky and an Old Lady-Bot.[18][19] The film was released in high definition on Blu-ray on March 22, 2011.[20] The Asian Blu-ray release of Robots includes Aunt Fanny's Tour of Booty, but it is not included on either the US nor European Blu-ray releases (possibly due to a request from the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) to remove the short from the Australian DVD release, for they gave the short a PG rating).[citation needed] The film was released on March 11, 2005, in the United States and Canada and grossed $36 million in 3,776 theaters in its opening weekend, ranking #1 at the box office.[21] It grossed a total of $260.7 million worldwide: $128.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $132.5 million in other territories.[2] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 64% based on 184 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Robots delights on a visual level, but the story feels like it came off an assembly line.\"[22] Metacritic gives the film a weighted average score of 64 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[23] Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an \"A\" on a scale of A+ to F.[24] Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, stating that \"this is a movie that is a joy to behold entirely apart from what it is about. It looks happy, and, more to the point, it looks harmonious.\"[25] Caroline Westbrook of Empire magazine gave the film a three stars out of five, and said, \"Kids will love it and their adult companions will be warmly entertained\u2014but it's far from a computer-animated classic.\"[26] Rob Mackie of The Guardian gave the film three stars out of five, saying that it \"skillfully combines adult and kids' comedy. But for all the imaginative splendours and a sharp script, Robots is never quite as distinctive as its predecessor, Ice Age.\"[27] Common Sense Media gave the film four stars out of five, calling it an \"endearing 'follow your dreams' story with plenty of laughs\".[28] Robots won an ASCAP award in the category of top box-office films. The movie received two Annie Award nominations (Outstanding Character Design in a Feature Production and Outstanding Production Design in an Animated Feature Production; both for William Joyce and Steve Martino for the latter) and two Kids' Choice Award nominations (Favorite Animated Movie and Favorite Voice From an Animated Movie for Robin Williams's performance as Fender). Robots was also nominated for a Teen Choice Award (Choice Movie: Animated/Computer Generated) and a Visual Effects Society Award.[citation needed] The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: Robots: Original Motion Picture Score was composed by John Powell, conducted by Pete Anthony, performed by the Hollywood Studio Symphony and released on March 15, 2005, by Var\u00e8se Sarabande and Fox Music.[30][31] A video game based on the film was released on February 24, 2005, for the Game Boy Advance, GameCube, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows. It was developed by Eurocom for home consoles and Windows, and by Griptonite Games for the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS. It was published by Vivendi Universal Games. The game received mixed to average reviews from critics.[32][33][34] Following the release of Robots, both Wedge and Joyce have expressed interest in making a sequel.[35][36] In light of the Release the Snyder Cut movement and the closure of Blue Sky Studios, a movement to release a director's cut of Robots gained traction in 2022.[37] A proposed director's cut was first mentioned on the film's original DVD audio commentary with Wedge and Joyce, in which Wedge said that there would be alternate takes in certain scenes, and that Cappy would have been more fleshed out.[38]",

In suspected violation of this order she was twice arrested.  By agreement with her husband, this order was discharged on 21 November, and, the following day, her husband wrote to the police withdrawing his complaints.  On 29 January 2003, the associated criminal charges against Goold were dismissed.  On 17 December 2002, Goold obtained leave to apply to the High Court (McKechnie J.) for judicial review of the constitutionality of Section 5 of the Domestic Violence Act, 1996, on the authority of which, the protection order had been issued.  The State argued that these proceedings should be disallowed due to their mootness.[3]  On succeeding only in part before the High Court, the State appealed to the Supreme Court. In the earlier case of DK v Crowley,[4] the Court had found other provisions of the Domestic Violence Act relating to orders barring a spouse from the family home to be unconstitutional for: \"[F]ailing to prescribe a fixed period of relatively short duration during which an interim barring order made ex parte is to continue in force, deprived the respondents to such applications of the protection of the principle of audi alteram partem in a manner and to an extent which is disproportionate, unreasonable and unnecessary.\"[4] The Court distinguished DK v Crowley on the basis that, at the time of the application for judicial review of the underlying legislation, no agreement had been reached regarding the order in question.  Noting the 'vital social purpose' served by domestic violence legislation,[1] the Court referred to the Canadian case of Borowski v. Canada[5] where the Supreme Court of Canada held that: \"[A]n appeal is moot when a decision will not have the effect of resolving some controversy affecting or potentially affecting the rights of the parties. Such a live controversy must be present not only when the action or proceedings is commenced but also when the Court is called upon to reach a decision.\"[5] Writing for the Court, Hardiman J. allowed the State's appeal. He held that since there was not a live \"concrete dispute between the parties\"[1] the case was moot and issued an order staying the proceedings. This case was applied in the cases of LOG v Child and Family Agency  [2017] IEHC 58 and MC v Legal Aid Board [2017] IEHC 26.",

Canada[5] where the Supreme Court of Canada held that: \"[A]n appeal is moot when a decision will not have the effect of resolving some controversy affecting or potentially affecting the rights of the parties. Such a live controversy must be present not only when the action or proceedings is commenced but also when the Court is called upon to reach a decision.\"[5] Writing for the Court, Hardiman J. allowed the State's appeal. He held that since there was not a live \"concrete dispute between the parties\"[1] the case was moot and issued an order staying the proceedings. This case was applied in the cases of LOG v Child and Family Agency [2017] IEHC 58 and MC v Legal Aid Board [2017] IEHC 26."

        "text": "Claudius V. Doral[1][2] (1923 \u2013 24 September 1996), better known as Claude Doral, was a Singaporean radio personality, actor and broadcaster. He later served as the Director of Broadcasting (Programmes) at Radio and Television Singapore until his retirement in 1972. Doral was born in Singapore in 1923.[3] He was of Eurasian descent.[4] He studied at the Saint Patrick's School, from which he graduated at age 14. He then began attending Raffles College but the Japanese Occupation of Singapore interrupted his studies.[3] During the occupation, he broadcast to Allied headquarters elsewhere in Southeast Asia from the Cathay Building on the conditions of the prisoner-of-war and internment camps in Singapore.[5] When the British returned to Singapore in 1945, Doral was \"engaged immediately\" at Radio Malaya. By November 1948, he was a newsreader, a presenter of several of Radio Malaya's programmes, a programme assistant for broadcasts to English schools and occasionally an actor in radio plays for the schools. \"Nan Hall\" of The Singapore Free Press noted then that Doral was not officially an announcer as the station did not have official announcers. All of the station's broadcasters had \"full-time office jobs that contribute[d] to the building and arrangement of programmes\". Hall noted that they \"broadcast[ed] in what [was] laughingly referred to as only their spare time.\"[5] In December, he was elected the honorary editor of the newly-formed Singapore Broadcasting Employees Union, which by then had over 300 members.[6] Doral and Islay Attenborough served as the assistant producers to the programme series Saturday Night at Eight, which began airing on the station's Blue Network on 23 April 1949.[7] He played a part in the Radio Malaya adaptation of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, which aired on 29 January 1950.[8] In June 1951, Doral was transferred over to Radio Malaya's Penang division as a programme assistant. Oswald Henry of The Singapore Standard reported that he had been a \"popular figure in Singapore radio circles.\"[9] By June 1952, he had instead been transferred over to the station's Kuala Lumpur division, where he had begun serving as a sportscaster, covering the Thomas Cup and the International badminton championships. His commentary was broadcast across Malaya. Ken Jalleh of The Singapore Standard reported that Doral \"was the most popular voice\" and that he \"did not miss a single thrill and his listeners missed nothing.\" Jalleh claimed that the Standard had received letters \"from all over Malaya, and as far as Sarawak and Borneo\", which were \"all in praise of Radio Malaya and Claude Doral.\" By then, he had also had parts in several radio plays.[3] He acted as a demon in the Malayan Arts Theatre's production of Tobias and the Angel, staged at the Kuala Lumpur Town Hall from 10 to 14 March 1953.[10] In July 1954, it was announced that Doral would be leaving for Britain on a six-month-long staff training course, becoming the fourth Radio Malaya employee to receive this opportunity. The Singapore Free Press then reported that he was \"well-known to Radio Malaya listeners for his running commentaries on sport.\" From 14 July to 11 August, he attended a vocational course at the University of Cambridge and he was a guest of the British Council for the first three months of the trip. After this, he spent the remainder of the trip with the BBC.[11] He returned to Singapore at the end of December.[12] Doral acted as Joe Borah in the \"well-received\" Radio Malaya comedy series Towkay's Tavern which began airing in mid-1955.[13] He also commentated for the Singapore Amateur Boxing Championships held around the same time. The Straits Times radio critic opined that Doral was \"barely audible thanks to the vociferous comments of his near neighbours.\"[14] He then covered the Malayan athletic championships in August. However, his commentary \"provoked some hard-hitting criticism from listeners\", with letters published in Radio Weekly, The Straits Times and The Sunday Times accusing him of \"displaying an appalling ignorance of everything connected with amateur athletics.\" The following month, it was announced that Doral would be covering the 1956 Summer Olympics, held in Melbourne, Australia from November to December, for Radio Malaya.[15] \"Mike Watcher\", despite having heavily criticised Doral's commentary for the Malayan athletic championships, opined that Doral \"[would] make a success\" of covering the Olympics, writing that Doral is \"normally able to give, perhaps not inspired commentaries, but certainly sound workmanlike broadcasts on a sport with which he is familiar.\"[16] Doral's first broadcast from Melbourne was an interview with an official, which \"Mike Watcher\" was \"not happy with\".[17] However, \"Mike Watcher\" later opined that after a \"somewhat shakey start\", Doral was \"making a good job of a very difficult task\" considering his \"lack of experience\".[18] Doral had become the English Programmes manager of Radio Malaya by June 1957.[19] The following year, he became the producer for the Radio Malaya adaptation of A.J.C. Pelham-Groom's stories following A.S.P. Latiff bin Ismail.[20] In December 1959, he provided the commentary for the station's coverage of Yusof Ishak's installation as president.[21] He then covered the 1960 Summer Olympics, held in Rome.[22] In August 1961, Doral left for the United States on a four month-long cultural exchange programme and study tour sponsored by the United States government, during which he was to attend seminars at the Syracuse University and the Purdue University, as well as to visit TV centres across the country.[23] By December 1962, he had become the assistant controller of commercial programmes at the station, which had been renamed Radio Singapore in 1959.[24] Doral narrated Television Looks at Singapore, the first film shown on TV Singapura, which began operating in early 1963. He had by then been made the Controller of Programmes.[25] In this period, he hosted the programmes Sports Parade and What Others Say.[22] He also provided the commentary for the 1958 Asian Games and the 1962 Asian Games.[26] Doral was appointed the Director of Programmes by September 1965.[27] He provided the commentary for the Asian Games in 1970. Doral officially retired from Radio and Television Singapore in March 1972.[26] However, he continued to write scripts and do voice-overs for commercials for the station.[22] Doral also went by \"Johan Abdullah\". His \"strong points\" were badminton, boxing and athletics.[22] By November 1948, Doral was studying law \"for relaxation\".[5] He married Hanim Zain, with whom he had two daughters and a son. In the 1980s, he suffered three strokes, though he reportedly remained \"very active and independent.\" On 22 September 1996, he suffered a stroke and was taken to the Singapore General Hospital, where he fell into a coma. He died on 24 September.[22]",

        "text": "The Ferrari 166 S is a sports car built by Ferrari between 1948 and 1953, as a evolution of its Colombo V12-powered 125 S racer. It was adapted into a sports car for the street in the form of the 166 Inter. Only 12 Ferrari 166 S were produced, nine of them with cycle-fenders as the Spyder Corsa. It was soon followed by the updated and highly successful Ferrari 166 MM (Mille Miglia), of which 47 were made from 1948 to 1953. Its early victories in the Targa Florio and Mille Miglia and others in international competition made the manufacturer a serious competitor in the racing industry.[4] Both were later replaced by the 2.3\u00a0L 195 S. The 166 shared its Aurelio Lampredi-designed tube frame[5] and double wishbone/live axle suspension with the 125. Like the 125, the wheelbase was 2420\u00a0mm long. Nine 166 Spyder Corsas and three 166 Sports were built. The first two 166 S models were coachbuilt by Carrozzeria Allemano and the last one by Carlo Anderloni at Carrozzeria Touring. Majority of the 166 MM cars were bodied at Touring in a barchetta form. The 1.5\u00a0L Gioacchino Colombo-designed V12 engine of the 125 was changed, however, with single overhead camshafts specified and a larger 2.0\u00a0L (1995\u00a0cc/121\u00a0in\u00b3) displacement. This was achieved with both a bore and stroke increase, to 60 by 58.8\u00a0mm respectively. Output was 110\u00a0PS (81\u00a0kW) at 5,600\u00a0rpm to 130\u00a0PS (96\u00a0kW) at 6,500\u00a0rpm with three carburetors, giving top speed of 170\u2013215\u00a0km/h (106\u2013134\u00a0mph).[6][7] For the 166 MM power output rose to 140\u00a0PS (103\u00a0kW) at 6,600\u00a0rpm and top speed to 220\u00a0km/h (137\u00a0mph).[8] Motor Trend Classic named the 166 MM Barchetta as number six in their list of the ten \"Greatest Ferraris of all time\".[9] The Ferrari 166 S won Targa Florio with Clemente Biondetti and Igor Troubetzkoy in 1948. In 1949, Biondetti also won in the 166 SC with Benedetti as co-driver. The 166 S won 1948 Mille Miglia, also driven by Biondetti, this time with Giuseppe Navone.[10] In 1949 Mille Miglia, the Ferrari 166 MM Barchettas scored 1-2 victory with Biondetti/Salani and Bonetto/Carpani respectively.[11] In 1949, the 166 MM also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the hands of Luigi Chinetti and Lord Selsdon, and so the \n166 was the only car ever to win all three races.[12] Another 166 won the 1949 Spa 24 Hours. A 166 chassis, this time with the bigger 195 S engine, won the Mille Miglia again in 1950 with drivers Giannino Marzotto and Marco Crosara. The oldest Ferrari car with an undisputed pedigree[citation needed] is s/n 002C, a 166 Spider Corsa which was originally a 159 and is currently owned and driven by James Glickenhaus. S/n 0052M, a 1950 166 MM Touring Barchetta was uncovered in a barn and was shown in public for the first time since 1959 in the August 2006 issue of Cavallino magazine. One 166 MM, 1949 s/n 0018M, was bodied by Zagato in 'Panoramica' style, very similar to their one-off Maserati A6 1500, also designed by Vieri Rapi. It is considered as first Ferrari coachbuilt by Zagato. A year later it was rebodied as Zagato Spyder.[13] The original car was recreated in 2007 as part of Zagato's Sanction Lost programme.[14]",

In 1949, Biondetti also won in the 166 SC with Benedetti as co-driver. The 166 S won 1948 Mille Miglia, also driven by Biondetti, this time with Giuseppe Navone.[10] In 1949 Mille Miglia, the Ferrari 166 MM Barchettas scored 1-2 victory with Biondetti/Salani and Bonetto/Carpani respectively.[11] In 1949, the 166 MM also won the 24 Hours of Le Mans in the hands of Luigi Chinetti and Lord Selsdon, and so the 166 was the only car ever to win all three races.[12] Another 166 won the 1949 Spa 24 Hours. A 166 chassis, this time with the bigger 195 S engine, won the Mille Miglia again in 1950 with drivers Giannino Marzotto and Marco Crosara. The oldest Ferrari car with an undisputed pedigree[citation needed] is s/n 002C, a 166 Spider Corsa which was originally a 159 and is currently owned and driven by James Glickenhaus.

The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.[1] The Dyer Estate is located north of Gorham center, on the west side of Fort Hill Road (Maine State Route 114), the main northbound route from the center.

It has a single-story porch extending across its front and south sides.[2] The construction date of the house is not known with certainty, but local records show that the original house was built ~1783-5; later renovations and extensions were added, with the current Greek-revival facade and porch being added probably sometime in the 1850s, by one of two known owners during that period.

        "text": "Tanya Joan Pliber\u0161ek[a] (born 2 December 1969) is an Australian politician who has served as Minister for Social Services since 2025 and the member of parliament (MP) for the New South Wales division of Sydney since 1998. Previously, she served as the Minister for the Environment and Water from 2022 to 2025, deputy leader of the Labor Party from 2013 to 2019, and held ministerial offices in the Rudd and Gillard governments. Plibersek was born in Sydney to Slovenian immigrant parents and grew up in Sutherland Shire. She has degrees from the University of Technology Sydney and Macquarie University, and worked in the NSW Government's Domestic Violence Unit before entering parliament. Plibersek was elected to the Division of Sydney at the 1998 federal election, aged 28. She joined the shadow cabinet in 2004, and when Labor won the 2007 election was made Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women. In a cabinet reshuffle in 2010, Plibersek was made Minister for Human Services and Minister for Social Inclusion. She was promoted to Minister for Health the following year, and held that position until Labor's defeat at the 2013 election. Plibersek was then elected as deputy to new ALP leader Bill Shorten. Plibersek served as deputy opposition leader until Labor's defeat at the 2019 Australian federal election. She was subsequently made shadow minister for education under new opposition leader Anthony Albanese. Upon Labor's victory at the 2022 Australian federal election, she was appointed Minister for the Environment and Water. After the 2025 federal election she was made Minister for Social Services in the Second Albanese ministry. She is a senior figure in the Labor Left faction. Plibersek was born in Sydney, the youngest of three children born to Joseph and Rose Plibersek. Her elder brother Ray is a lawyer, and her eldest brother Phillip (d. 1997) was a geologist. Her parents were born in small Slovenian villages, arriving in Australia unknown to each other as part of the post-war immigration scheme. Her mother (n\u00e9e Rosalija Repi\u010d) was born in Podvinci, and came to Australia via Italy. Her father (n\u00e9 Jo\u017ee Pliber\u0161ek) was born in Ko\u010dno pri Polskavi, and came to Australia via Austria. He found work as a labourer on the Snowy Mountains Scheme, and later spent 20 years working for Qantas as a plumber and gas fitter.[1][2] Plibersek grew up in the suburb of Oyster Bay in Sydney's Sutherland Shire. She attended Oyster Bay Public School and Jannali Girls High School, where she was the dux. She joined the Labor Party at the age of 15.[1] Plibersek studied journalism at the University of Technology Sydney, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in communications. She then took a Masters in Public Policy and Politics at Macquarie University.[3][4] After a failed attempt to secure a cadetship with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), she found work with the Domestic Violence Unit at the New South Wales Government's Office for the Status and Advancement of Women.[3] She found working with the state women's minister Kerry Chikarovski \"demoralising\" and later criticised her for focusing on the glass ceiling rather than other women's issues. Plibersek subsequently joined the office of Senator Bruce Childs, before switching to work for Senator George Campbell as a research officer.[5] Plibersek was elected to the House of Representatives at the 1998 federal election, aged 28,[6] retaining the Division of Sydney for the ALP following the retirement of Peter Baldwin. With the support of George Campbell's \"hard left\" faction, she won preselection for the seat against twelve other candidates, including ten other women. In the lead-up to the ballot she \"wrote to each branch member three or four times, attended branch meetings virtually every night, gave talks to community groups, and contributed to three candidates' debates\".[5] Plibersek supported Kim Beazley's unsuccessful candidacies in the 2003 ALP leadership votes, where he initially lost to Simon Crean and then later to Mark Latham.[7] In July 2003 she and Anthony Albanese publicly criticised Crean for his rejection of the party's policy on a Second Sydney Airport.[8] After the 2004 election, Plibersek was elected to Latham's shadow ministry and allocated three portfolios \u2013 youth; the status of women; and work and family, community and early childhood education. In June 2005, after Latham was succeeded as opposition leader by Beazley, she retained the youth and status of women portfolios and was given responsibility for childcare.[6] Upon the release of The Latham Diaries she described him as \"a negative and critical person\".[9] Plibersek publicly supported Beazley against Kevin Rudd in the 2006 leadership spill, though was retained in Rudd's shadow ministry after his defeat of Beazley, with the portfolios of youth; the status of women; and human services and housing.[6] Following the 2007 federal election, Plibersek was appointed Minister for Housing and Minister for the Status of Women in the First Rudd Ministry. Following the 2010 federal election, Plibersek was appointed Minister for Human Services and Minister for Social Inclusion. Her appointment took effect following the birth of Plibersek's youngest son Louis, and soon afterwards Plibersek directed the Human Services response to the 2010\u201311 Queensland floods. As Minister for Human Services, Plibersek established emergency and recovery centres to provide urgent support to flood-affected communities.[citation needed] As Minister for Housing, Plibersek established the National Rental Affordability Scheme to build 50,000 affordable rental homes, invested $6\u00a0billion in social housing to build 21,600 new homes and repair 80,000 homes, and provided $550\u00a0million for homelessness services.

She also established the Housing Affordability Fund and First Home Saver Accounts.[10] In December 2008, along with Kevin Rudd, Prime Minister at that time, Plibersek released the Government's White Paper on Homelessness, The Road Home, which expressed a goal of halving homelessness by 2020.[11] This goal was abandoned by the incoming Abbott government which cut homelessness funding and ended the National Rental Affordability Scheme and First Home Saver Accounts.[citation needed] As Minister for the Status of Women, Plibersek convened the National Council to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children in May 2008, and released the National Council's Plan for Australia to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children in March 2009 \u2013 the first in Australian history.[12][13] Plibersek also addressed the 2009 United Nations International Women's Day event, attended by United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, and announced Australia's formal accession to the United Nations Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW).[14] Plibersek said that acceding to the Optional Protocol \"will send a strong message that Australia is serious about promoting gender equality and that we are prepared to be judged by international human rights standards.\"[15] Plibersek played a key role in designing and securing Australia's first paid parental leave scheme. Plibersek also strengthened Australia's anti-people trafficking strategy, with a focus on better supporting victims including women in the sex industry.[16] As Shadow Minister for Women, Plibersek also committed the Labor Opposition to expanding access to abortions by making termination services legal in all taxpayer-funded hospitals. This policy was later dumped from Labor's election commitments under Albanese.[17] In Opposition, Plibersek supported women's economic security by committing the Labor Opposition to the removal of the $450 per month minimum income threshold for eligibility for the superannuation guarantee, a policy later adopted by the Liberal Government.[18] Plibersek also committed to forcing companies with over one thousand employees to disclose the gap in salaries between male and female staff. This was dismissed by the Morrison Liberal Government at the time as setting \"one set of employees against another\".[19] As Minister for Health Plibersek established Grow Up Smiling, a $4\u00a0billion package to support better dental care for children, which expanded Medicare-subsided dental check-ups for children from age 2 to 17. She introduced free Gardasil vaccinations, previously only available for girls, for boys to protect against cancers caused by HPV \u2013 a world first.[20] Along with the previous Health Minister, Nicola Roxon, Plibersek also implemented world-leading plain packaging of tobacco laws which saw smoking rates drop to 13%.[citation needed] Plibersek also added the RU486 abortion pill to the PBS, improving access to reproductive healthcare.[21] When Plibersek was Minister for Health, Australia achieved the best 5-year cancer survival rates in the world. Plibersek also delivered 1,300 more hospital beds and 60,000 additional doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. She also oversaw the funding, construction and/or opening of a number of new facilities, including the Chris O\u2019Brien Lifehouse Cancer Centre, the Kinghorn Cancer Centre, the Launceston Multi-Purpose Health Centre, and a new medical and dental school as well as new facilities for the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI) in Adelaide.[citation needed] Plibersek further added\u202f87 new medicines\u202fto the\u202fPharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS)\u202fbetween\u202f2012\u20132013. introduced the\u202fLiving Longer Living Better reforms,[22] allocating\u202f$1.2 billion\u202fto improve\u202faged care services\u202fbetween\u202f2012\u20132013, approved the\u202ffirst rapid HIV test\u202ffor point-of-care use in Australia, providing results within an hour.[23] Plibersek was unanimously elected deputy leader of the Labor Party (and thus Deputy Leader of the Opposition) on 14 October 2013, following the leadership election that had seen Bill Shorten succeed Kevin Rudd as leader.[24] She was Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Development until July 2016. Following the 2016 election, she was made Shadow Minister for Education and Shadow Minister for Women.[25] Shorten said handing Plibersek the education portfolio was \"about putting a great policy thinker on the political frontline\".[26] Plibersek was re-elected at the 2019 election with a swing of 5.7 points to the Labor Party. Following the party's defeat at the federal election of 2019 and Bill Shorten's immediate resignation as party leader, Plibersek made it known that she was interested in standing in the leadership election, and was supported by Shorten and former prime minister Julia Gillard; however, she concluded that \"now is not my time\", citing family responsibilities.[27][28][29] After Anthony Albanese's victory in the leadership contest, Plibersek was appointed Shadow Minister for Education and Training in his new shadow cabinet.[30] In January 2021 Albanese also appointed her Shadow Minister for Women.[31] Plibersek was appointed Minister for the Environment and Water in the first Albanese ministry.[32] Upon Peter Dutton's election as Leader of the Opposition, Plibersek compared Dutton to Lord Voldemort. In a radio interview, she stated: \"I think there will be a lot of children who have watched a lot of Harry Potter films who will be very frightened of what they are seeing on TV at night. I am saying he looks a bit like Voldemort. We will see whether he can do what he promised he would do when he was last running for leader, which is smile more.\"[33] Plibersek later apologised. In a radio interview, Dutton called the claims \"unfortunate\" but \"water off a duck's back\", also noting that he wasn't \"bald by choice\" and was diagnosed with a skin condition several years ago.[33] Plibersek's apology was welcomed by newly elected Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in an interview with ABC News.[33] In November 2024, Plibersek reached an agreement with the Greens and independent senator David Pocock to pass legislation to create a national environment protection agency. However, the legislation was scrapped at the last minute after intervention from Prime Minister Albanese.[34][35][36] After the re-election of the Albanese government in the 2025 federal election, Plibersek was moved to the role of Minister for Social Services in the second Albanese ministry.[37] Plibersek is a member of the Labor Party's left faction. Plibersek has argued that government should actively invest in the economy to promote growth and equality, calling for a federal commitment to a policy of full employment where \"Australians who can work, can get a job\". During the coronavirus recession of 2020, she has advocated government stimulus over tax cuts for high income earners. In September 2020, she explained her priorities for economic recovery: \"We need to be building things in Australia to support both the skilled trades people and the apprentices that we should be training right now. We need to build things. We need to make things. We need to care for people. We need secure jobs with decent pay\". Education Plibersek is a long-term supporter of investing in education. As the shadow Minister for Education and Training she has developed policies across schools, universities, TAFE and vocational education. Prior to the 2019 election, these policies included increasing school funding by $14 billion over a decade, to the creation of a new Evidence Institute for Schools and instituting a review of the country's NAPLAN testing system. In higher education Plibersek promised to reintroduce the demand driven system of university funding, creating an extra 200,000 places for students. Energy Plibersek is a strong supporter of renewable energy and transitioning towards clean energy production. She has argued that the renewables industry is key to promoting new jobs, assisting local manufacturing, lowering carbon emissions and reducing power prices. She has also endorsed programs to help households install solar panels on their homes \u2013 which have been adopted by over two and a half million Australia households. In 2018, Plibersek argued against providing federal subsidies for new coal fired power plants. Housing\nAfter the 2007 election, Plibersek was made Federal Minister for Housing in the Rudd government. As part of the government's response to the 2008 financial crisis, Plibersek implemented several policies that both grew the housing stock and stimulated the Australian economy. These policies included the First Home Owners Boost, providing up to $21,000 for people buying new dwellings, the National Rental Affordability Scheme, providing incentives for investors to build properties for low and middle income Australians, and $6 billion for the construction, repair and improvement of social housing. Plibersek also released the Homelessness White Paper, which set out a comprehensive national plan to tackle homelessness in Australia with significant funding attached. Plibersek has argued that significant new investment in social and public housing should be part of Australia's response to the coronavirus economic downturn. Welfare Plibersek supports an increase to Newstart, Australia's then-unemployment benefit, arguing that the current rate is too low, \"trapping people in poverty\" who are \"just surviving\" on an allowance of $40 a day. Women's reproductive rights Plibersek is pro-choice. As Minister for Health, Plibersek approved listing the abortion drug RU-486 on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Plibersek described the provision of the medicine as \"a good thing in the situation where women are faced with one of the most difficult decisions that they will ever make\".[38] Anti-abortion groups criticised the move, with one campaigner, Margaret Tighe, labelling it a \"gross abuse of power.\"[39] Other commentators, including Clementine Ford, labelled the decision \"progressive\".[40][41] First Nations people Plibersek supports instituting an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, based on the recommendations made in the Uluru Statement from the Heart. As Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, she stated that implementing the Indigenous Voice was her party's priority in Indigenous affairs, alongside \u2018closing the gap\u2019, particularly in health and education. An Australian republic Plibersek supports Australia becoming a Republic. As a first term Member of Parliament in 1999, she campaigned for the yes vote in the constitutional referendum to replace the Queen and Governor-General with a President appointed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament. LGBT rights From the 1990s onward, Plibersek campaigned for the removal of discrimination against same-sex de facto couples from federal legislation, raising the issue formally in Parliament on multiple occasions during her parliamentary career (including 1999,[42] 2006,[43] and 2008[44]). In her regular paid advertisement in the South Sydney Herald, Plibersek wrote that \"The passing of these reforms to federal legislation was one of the proudest moments of my time in the Australian Parliament\"[45] and she has marched in the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade almost every year for three decades.[46] As deputy leader, Plibersek led the push to make support for same-sex marriage binding Labor policy[47] which resulted in many Labor MPs speaking out publicly in support of same-sex marriage. Plibersek seconded a private members bill to legalise same sex marriage, moved by Labor leader Bill Shorten. She opposed the 2017 postal plebiscite, arguing it was unnecessary and divisive, but campaigned strongly for the \u2018yes\u2019 vote during the plebiscite campaign. Multiculturalism and citizenship As an Australian with Slovenian heritage, Plibersek is vocal advocate for multiculturalism. On an episode of Q&A in 2018 she clashed with conservative Senator Matthew Canavan on the topic of immigration, arguing against Canavan's claim that immigrants congregated through \u2018ghettoisation\u2019. Before the 2019 election, Plibersek pledged $8\u00a0million towards community language schools, to expand language training for children. In January 2020 Plibersek aroused controversy in an Australia Day speech, calling for children to learn the Australian citizenship pledge at school.[48][49] In the speech, Plibersek argued that progressives should feel more comfortable with the concept of patriotism: \"You can be proud of your citizenship and dedicated to progress. You can cherish this nation and want to make it better. You can be a progressive and love your country: I certainly do.\" Foreign aid As Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Plibersek opposed the cuts to foreign aid made by the Abbott Liberal government. At the 2016 election Labor promised to reverse those cuts if elected. Iraq Plibersek opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[50] In 2003, when then-US President George W. Bush visited Australia, Tanya presented national security adviser Condoleezza Rice with a letter, signed by 43 Labor MPs, explaining why Labor parliamentarians opposed Australia invading Iraq without United Nations approval.[51] She also stated in Parliament, \"I do not support an attack on Iraq. I particularly do not support a pre-emptive first strike. Nor do I support any action that is initiated by the US alone rather than being sanctioned by the United Nations.\"[50] East Timor While Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2016, Plibersek proposed that Australia redraw its maritime border with East Timor. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, \"Ms Plibersek lamented that Australia's pivotal role in securing East Timor's independence \u2013 \"a proud moment\" \u2013 was being tarnished by its refusal to negotiate a new, permanent maritime boundary with East Timor. \"The maritime boundary dispute has poisoned relations with our newest neighbour. This must change for their sake and ours,\" Ms Plibersek said.\"[52]\nThis position was later adopted by the Liberal government, and a new border agreement treaty was signed in 2018. Israel Speaking in the House of Representatives on 17 September 2002, Plibersek said: \"I can think of a rogue state which consistently ignores UN resolutions, whose ruler is a war criminal responsible for the massacres of civilians in refugee camps outside its borders. The US supports and funds this country. This year it gave it a blank cheque to continue its repression of its enemies. It uses US military hardware to bulldoze homes and kill civilians. It is called Israel, and the war criminal is Ariel Sharon. Needless to say, the US does not mention the UN resolutions that Israel has ignored for 30 years; it just continues sending the money...\"[53] Plibersek's remarks again gained prominence in October 2013, after she and Bill Shorten were elected as deputy leader and leader of the Labor Party, respectively. After choosing to take on the foreign affairs portfolio while in opposition, Liberal Party MP Julie Bishop, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, said Plibersek should \"publicly retract those statements\". The Australian noted that Plibersek's appointment was likely to be criticised by the Jewish community in Australia.[54] But the Executive Council of Australian Jewry expressed satisfaction in Plibersek's elevation to the deputy leadership, noting that she had \u2018developed friendly relations with the Jewish Community\u2019. Plibersek visited Israel and the State of Palestine in February 2014, meeting with the Prime Minister of Palestine, Rami Hamdallah.[55] Plibersek has held the following portfolios and parliamentary party positions since her election in 1998 (both shadow and government appointments are listed):[6] Plibersek lives in Sydney with her husband Michael Coutts-Trotter, who is a senior NSW public servant, and three children.[56] Following the 2010 federal election, when Labor retained government with the support of the Australian Greens and independents, parliamentary numbers were finely balanced. After some controversy, Plibersek was granted a pair by the Coalition so that her absence from the House of Representatives while on maternity leave did not affect the result of votes.[57] She gave birth to her son later that year.[58][59] In September 2016, her older brother Ray Plibersek was elected to Sutherland Shire council representing C Ward for the Australian Labor Party.[60] Plibersek is fond of bushwalking and Jane Austen[61] novels.",

She attended Oyster Bay Public School and Jannali Girls High School, where she was the dux. She joined the Labor Party at the age of 15.[1] Plibersek studied journalism at the University of Technology Sydney, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in communications. She then took a Masters in Public Policy and Politics at Macquarie University.[3][4] After a failed attempt to secure a cadetship with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), she found work with the Domestic Violence Unit at the New South Wales Government's Office for the Status and Advancement of Women.[3] She found working with the state women's minister Kerry Chikarovski \"demoralising\" and later criticised her for focusing on the glass ceiling rather than other women's issues.

During the coronavirus recession of 2020, she has advocated government stimulus over tax cuts for high income earners. In September 2020, she explained her priorities for economic recovery: \"We need to be building things in Australia to support both the skilled trades people and the apprentices that we should be training right now. We need to build things. We need to make things. We need to care for people. We need secure jobs with decent pay\". Education Plibersek is a long-term supporter of investing in education.

Education Plibersek is a long-term supporter of investing in education. As the shadow Minister for Education and Training she has developed policies across schools, universities, TAFE and vocational education. Prior to the 2019 election, these policies included increasing school funding by $14 billion over a decade, to the creation of a new Evidence Institute for Schools and instituting a review of the country's NAPLAN testing system. In higher education Plibersek promised to reintroduce the demand driven system of university funding, creating an extra 200,000 places for students. Energy Plibersek is a strong supporter of renewable energy and transitioning towards clean energy production. She has argued that the renewables industry is key to promoting new jobs, assisting local manufacturing, lowering carbon emissions and reducing power prices. She has also endorsed programs to help households install solar panels on their homes \u2013 which have been adopted by over two and a half million Australia households. In 2018, Plibersek argued against providing federal subsidies for new coal fired power plants. Housing After the 2007 election, Plibersek was made Federal Minister for Housing in the Rudd government. As part of the government's response to the 2008 financial crisis, Plibersek implemented several policies that both grew the housing stock and stimulated the Australian economy. These policies included the First Home Owners Boost, providing up to $21,000 for people buying new dwellings, the National Rental Affordability Scheme, providing incentives for investors to build properties for low and middle income Australians, and $6 billion for the construction, repair and improvement of social housing. Plibersek also released the Homelessness White Paper, which set out a comprehensive national plan to tackle homelessness in Australia with"

Plibersek also released the Homelessness White Paper, which set out a comprehensive national plan to tackle homelessness in Australia with significant funding attached. Plibersek has argued that significant new investment in social and public housing should be part of Australia's response to the coronavirus economic downturn. Welfare Plibersek supports an increase to Newstart, Australia's then-unemployment benefit, arguing that the current rate is too low, \"trapping people in poverty\" who are \"just surviving\" on an allowance of $40 a day. Women's reproductive rights Plibersek is pro-choice. As Minister for Health, Plibersek approved listing the abortion drug RU-486 on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Plibersek described the provision of the medicine as \"a good thing in the situation where women are faced with one of the most difficult decisions that they will ever make\".[38] Anti-abortion groups criticised the move, with one campaigner, Margaret Tighe, labelling it a \"gross abuse of power.\"[39] Other commentators, including Clementine Ford, labelled the decision \"progressive\".[40][41] First Nations people Plibersek supports instituting an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, based on the recommendations made in the Uluru Statement from the Heart. As Deputy Leader of the Labor Party, she stated that implementing the Indigenous Voice was her party's priority in Indigenous affairs, alongside \u2018closing the gap\u2019, particularly in health and education. An Australian republic Plibersek supports Australia becoming a Republic. As a first term Member of Parliament in 1999, she campaigned for the yes vote in the constitutional referendum to replace the Queen and Governor-General with a President appointed by a two-thirds majority of the members of the Commonwealth Parliament.

LGBT rights From the 1990s onward, Plibersek campaigned for the removal of discrimination against same-sex de facto couples from federal legislation, raising the issue formally in Parliament on multiple occasions during her parliamentary career (including 1999,[42] 2006,[43] and 2008[44]). In her regular paid advertisement in the South Sydney Herald, Plibersek wrote that \"The passing of these reforms to federal legislation was one of the proudest moments of my time in the Australian Parliament\"[45] and she has marched in the Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Parade almost every year for three decades.[46] As deputy leader, Plibersek led the push to make support for same-sex marriage binding Labor policy[47] which resulted in many Labor MPs speaking out publicly in support of same-sex marriage. Plibersek seconded a private members bill to legalise same sex marriage, moved by Labor leader Bill Shorten. She opposed the 2017 postal plebiscite, arguing it was unnecessary and divisive, but campaigned strongly for the \u2018yes\u2019 vote during the plebiscite campaign. Multiculturalism and citizenship As an Australian with Slovenian heritage, Plibersek is vocal advocate for multiculturalism. On an episode of Q&A in 2018 she clashed with conservative Senator Matthew Canavan on the topic of immigration, arguing against Canavan's claim that immigrants congregated through \u2018ghettoisation\u2019. Before the 2019 election, Plibersek pledged $8 million towards community language schools, to expand language training for children. In January 2020 Plibersek aroused controversy in an Australia Day speech, calling for children to learn the Australian citizenship pledge at school.[48][49] In the speech, Plibersek argued that progressives should feel more comfortable with the concept of patriotism:"

You can cherish this nation and want to make it better. You can be a progressive and love your country: I certainly do.\" Foreign aid As Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Plibersek opposed the cuts to foreign aid made by the Abbott Liberal government. At the 2016 election Labor promised to reverse those cuts if elected. Iraq Plibersek opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq.[50] In 2003, when then-US President George W. Bush visited Australia, Tanya presented national security adviser Condoleezza Rice with a letter, signed by 43 Labor MPs, explaining why Labor parliamentarians opposed Australia invading Iraq without United Nations approval.[51] She also stated in Parliament, \"I do not support an attack on Iraq. I particularly do not support a pre-emptive first strike. Nor do I support any action that is initiated by the US alone rather than being sanctioned by the United Nations.\"[50] East Timor While Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2016, Plibersek proposed that Australia redraw its maritime border with East Timor. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, \"Ms Plibersek lamented that Australia's pivotal role in securing East Timor's independence \u2013 \"a proud moment\" \u2013 was being tarnished by its refusal to negotiate a new, permanent maritime boundary with East Timor. \"The maritime boundary dispute has poisoned relations with our newest neighbour. This must change for their sake and ours,\" Ms Plibersek said.\"[52] This position was later adopted by the Liberal government, and a new border"

Israel Speaking in the House of Representatives on 17 September 2002, Plibersek said: \"I can think of a rogue state which consistently ignores UN resolutions, whose ruler is a war criminal responsible for the massacres of civilians in refugee camps outside its borders. The US supports and funds this country. This year it gave it a blank cheque to continue its repression of its enemies. It uses US military hardware to bulldoze homes and kill civilians. It is called Israel, and the war criminal is Ariel Sharon. Needless to say, the US does not mention the UN resolutions that Israel has ignored for 30 years; it just continues sending the money...\"[53] Plibersek's remarks again gained prominence in October 2013, after she and Bill Shorten were elected as deputy leader and leader of the Labor Party, respectively. After choosing to take on the foreign affairs portfolio while in opposition, Liberal Party MP Julie Bishop, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, said Plibersek should \"publicly retract those statements\". The Australian noted that Plibersek's appointment was likely to be criticised by the Jewish community in Australia.[54] But the Executive Council of Australian Jewry expressed satisfaction in Plibersek's elevation to the deputy leadership, noting that she had \u2018developed friendly relations with the Jewish Community\u2019. Plibersek visited Israel and the State of Palestine in February 2014, meeting with the Prime Minister of Palestine, Rami Hamdallah.[55] Plibersek has held the following portfolios and parliamentary party positions since her election in 1998"

After some controversy, Plibersek was granted a pair by the Coalition so that her absence from the House of Representatives while on maternity leave did not affect the result of votes.[57] She gave birth to her son later that year.[58][59] In September 2016, her older brother Ray Plibersek was elected to Sutherland Shire council representing C Ward for the Australian Labor Party.[60] Plibersek is fond of bushwalking and Jane Austen[61] novels."

He was born on May 19, 1948, in Nanking and grew up in Hong Kong. Throughout the twenty-four years of his acting career, Chin had participated in over one hundred films. As a member of the \"Two Qins, Two Lins\" (\u4e8c\u79e6\u4e8c\u6797), Charlie Chin is known for portraying the romantic interest of the female lead in a love triangle in Literary Romantic Films (\u611b\u60c5\u6587\u85dd\u7247) in the 1970s. He received two Golden Horse Awards for his performance as best leading actor. When he was young, Charlie Chin fled with his family to Hong Kong due to war. At the age of twelve, he went to Taiwan to pursue his studies at the Fu Xing Drama School (\u5fa9\u8208\u5287\u6821; predecessor of\u00a0National Taiwan College of Performing Arts), specializing in Peking Opera.[1] He adopted the stage name Qin Fu Lin (\u79e6\u5fa9\u6797) and selected the role of a combatant (\u6b66\u751f) in the opera. After graduating from the Fu Xing Drama School in 1968, Charlie Chin returned to Hong Kong and made some martial arts films, but he remained unknown. While he was wondering whether he should stay in the field of Peking Opera, actor Yue Hua (\u5cb3\u83ef) advised him to become an actor.[1] Charlie Chin was privately nicknamed \"Flipper (\u7ffb\u8ddf\u6597)\" due to his acrobatic skills in the film industry. At that time, the industry favored the warm-hearted type of male stars represented by Chin Han (\u79e6\u6f22), making it difficult for him to secure significant roles.[2] Charlie Chin was part of the \"Silver Rat Squad (\u9280\u8272\u9f20\u968a)\", a 1970s pop band formed in Hong Kong. The band, consisting of seven members.was inspired by\u00a0 Hollywood actor Dean Martin's Rat Pack.[3] The band was more of a lighthearted endeavor, and all the members were renowned actors at the time. The other members of the squad included Chan Chi Keung (\u9673\u81ea\u5f37), Zhang Chong (\u5f35\u6c96), Patrick Tse Ka Yuk (\u8b1d\u8ce2), Alan Tang Kwong Wing (\u9127\u5149\u69ae), Lydia Sum Tin Ha (\u6c88\u6bbf\u971e), and Chen Hao (\u9673\u6d69).[4] The turning point of Charlie Chin's acting career happened in 1973. Director Lee Hsing (\u674e\u884c) was shooting the film Heart With A Million Knots (\u5fc3\u6709\u5343\u5343\u7d50). The original male lead, Alan Tang Kwong Wing (\u9127\u5149\u69ae), could not participate due to schedule conflict. Charlie Chin was recommended to Lee Hsing by Chen Chen's mother. So he took on the role of the male lead for the first time. The film made him a star overnight.[5] This role also landed him the Best Actor award for Outstanding Performance at the 20th Asian Film Festival.[6] In the 1970s, literary romantic films adapted from romantic novels by Qiong Yao and other writers were extremely popular in Taiwan and South East Asia. During that time, Charlie Chin, along with renowned actors Chin Han (\u79e6\u6f22), Brigitte Lin (\u6797\u9752\u971e), and Joan Lin (\u6797\u9cf3\u5b0c) were collectively called the \"Two Qins, Two Lins\" (\u4e8c\u79e6\u4e8c\u6797) to indicate their dominating status.[6] In 1975 and 1977, Charlie Chin won the Best Actor award at the 12th and 14th Golden Horse Awards, respectively, for his performances in Long Way from Home (\u9577\u60c5\u842c\u7e37) directed by Liu Yi (\u5289\u85dd) and Far Away from Home (\u4eba\u5728\u5929\u6daf) directed by Pai Ching-jui (\u767d\u666f\u745e). In 1973, Charlie Chin went to Japan to film the Hiroshima 28 (\u5ee3\u5cf6\u5eff\u516b). It was during this time that he met actress Siao Fong Fong (\u856d\u82b3\u82b3), and they began dating. In October 1975, they got married at the Hong Kong City Hall. However. Their marriage lasted only for a few years and they agreed to separate in 1977 and divorce in the following year.[5] In 1976, while filming Cloud of Romance (\u6211\u662f\u4e00\u7247\u96f2),\u00a0 Chin met Brigitte Lin\u00a0 (\u6797\u9752\u971e) and they began dating.[7] In September 1980, they got engaged in Los Angeles.

        "text": "Arthur J Stedman FRIBA (1868\u20131958) was a British architect in the Late-Victorian and Edwardian periods. He was a prominent architect in and around Farnham, Surrey where he was educated, lived and died. Arthur's career flourished in the country house boom up to World War I, moving onto larger public works in the great expansion of municipal works projects in the interwar period. He finally retired in 1955 at the age of 87. He completed a number of fine works in West Surrey, including his own offices at 36 South Street (now demolished) and the McDonald Almshouses in West Street, Farnham and some fine Edwardian country houses. He was also responsible for some fine restoration and infill projects within the historic urban fabric of Farnham, complementing the Georgian style that predominates there: His design for 49 Castle Street, Pevsner called a very good imitation.[1] He was a near contemporary of Edwin Lutyens, an architect whose buildings litter the countryside and towns of West Surrey and in whose London office, Arthur's 2nd son, Leonard, was articled as a young man. Stedman was just 1 year younger than Lutyens and 7 years older than the other eminent Farnham architect, Harold Falkner. Arthur apprenticed as an architect in the traditional way, with a firm of Farnham builders and attended night classes at Farnham Art School, (forerunner of the University for the Creative Arts). He finally set up his own office in 1895 at the age of 28 and was elected RIBA in 1910 and a Fellow (FRIBA) before the War. He was Guildford Diocesan Surveyor from 1925\u20131950 and taught drawing and building technology at the Farnham School of Art.

He was a prominent architect in and around Farnham, Surrey where he was educated, lived and died. Arthur's career flourished in the country house boom up to World War I, moving onto larger public works in the great expansion of municipal works projects in the interwar period. He finally retired in 1955 at the age of 87. He completed a number of fine works in West Surrey, including his own offices at 36 South Street (now demolished) and the McDonald Almshouses in West Street, Farnham and some fine Edwardian country houses. He was also responsible for some fine restoration and infill projects within the historic urban fabric of Farnham, complementing the Georgian style that predominates there: His design for 49 Castle Street, Pevsner called a very good imitation.[1] He was a near contemporary of Edwin Lutyens, an architect whose buildings litter the countryside and towns of West Surrey and in whose London office, Arthur's 2nd son, Leonard, was articled as a young man. Stedman was just 1 year younger than Lutyens and 7 years older than the other eminent Farnham architect, Harold Falkner. Arthur apprenticed as an architect in the traditional way, with a firm of Farnham builders and attended night classes at Farnham Art School, (forerunner of the University for the Creative Arts). He finally set up his own office in 1895 at the age of 28 and was elected RIBA in 1910 and a Fellow (FRIBA) before the War. He was Guildford Diocesan Surveyor from 1925\u20131950 and taught drawing and building technology at the Farnham School of Art.

        "text": "The Story of Art, by E. H. Gombrich, is a survey of the history of art from ancient times to the modern era.[1] First published in 1950 by Phaidon, the book is widely regarded both as a seminal work of criticism and as one of the most accessible introductions to the visual arts. It was originally intended for younger readers.[2] Over eight million copies have been sold, and it has been translated into more than 30 languages.[3] As of 2022, The Story of Art is in its 16th edition.[3] The art historian Ernst Gombrich had experience with book production before The Story of Art; he collaborated with Ernst Kris on an unpublished book on the history of caricature and published his first book on the history of the world for children in 1936.[4] That same year, Gombrich relocated to London from Vienna for a job synthesising the late Aby Warburg's notes for publication at the Warburg Institute.[5] However, with the rise of the Second World War, Gombrich was sent to work as a broadcast translator at a BBC listening post in Evesham.[5] There he met B\u00e9la Horovitz, founder of Phaidon Press, who was lacking materials to publish due to the war and was in search of new material.[5] Gombrich, having already written a few chapters of an art history book for children while in Vienna, offered the work and was given an advance for the work that became The Story of Art, first published by Phaidon in 1950.[5] The book is divided into a preface, introduction, and 27 chapters that each deal with art within a defined time period and geographical context. A 28th chapter summarises the latest developments in visual arts. The chapters in the 15th edition are listed as follows: Each chapter discusses a selection of works from the defined period, and all of the works discussed are accompanied by illustrations. More than half of the book's pages are devoted to colour photographs of paintings, drawings, architecture and sculptures. In the preface, Gombrich explains that it has been his intention not to mention any work of art that he could not also include as an illustration. The Story of Art is often described as a work that provides an accessible introduction to the subject of art history.[4][7][8][5] The art historian T. S. R. Boase, writing in The Times Literary Supplement, observed that Gombrich \"writes conversationally and intimately\".[7] Gombrich himself notes in the preface of the book that he intends to use \"plain language\" and to keep use of \"the art historian's conventional terms\" to a minimum.[9] First published by Phaidon Press in 1950 and in its 16th edition as of 2022, The Story of Art has been a global bestseller with more than 8 million copies sold; it has been translated into more than 30 languages.[3] It is included in Time magazine's list of 100 best nonfiction books of all time.[10] The first two sentences of the book have become famous: \"There really is no such thing as Art. There are only artists\".[2] Gombrich later elaborated on this statement by saying that he defines \"art\" based on its Latin root, meaning \"skill\", and that there is \"no disembodied skill\".[11] Upon its release, The Story of Art was noted for its pedagogical potential[8][12] despite Gombrich's intentions of producing a pleasure read for teenagers.[12] The artist and art history professor H. W. Janson, reviewing the book for College Art Journal, remarked that it was \"undoubtedly destined for a most successful career in the classroom\".[8] He praised the book for its accessible language and selections free from Gombrich's own preferences, measuring the book against scholarly standards.[8] In his discussion of the book in The Burlington Magazine, the artist and writer Wilfrid Blunt noted that The Story of Art reads like a lecture.[12] Though he believed the lecture-like tone would lead masters to prefer the book rather than students, he declared that The Story of Art \"fully deserve[s] a place in any educational library\".[12] Criticism has also emerged since the book's release. One stream of criticism addresses Gombrich's treatment of contemporary art.[5][13][14] In a 1989 review for Art Journal of the book\u2019s 14th edition, the art history professor Bradford R. Collins criticised the work for its lack of depth in its discussion of contemporary art.[13] Collins indicated that Gombrich's commentary on 20th-century art was brief and often dismissive.[13] Elly Miller, daughter of B\u00e9la Horovitz, revealed in an interview that Gombrich had not originally intended to include an additional chapter on contemporary art and that \"he really didn't come to terms with what he called modern art\".[5] The art curator Karen Wilkin made similar comments for The Hudson Review, remarking of The Story of Art that \"[Gombrich] was never really at ease with anything but illusionistic painting and sculpture\".[14] Gombrich's omission of non-Western and female artists has also been the subject of criticism,[15][16][17] with no women having been included in the first The Story of Art and just one included in the 16th edition.[15] With the intention of offsetting the emphasis on white, male, and Western works in Gombrich's globally influential book, the curator and art historian Katy Hessel responded to the lack of diverse representation by creating a book of works by a range of international female artists titled The Story of Art Without Men, published in 2022.[18][15] The Story of Art on Internet Archive",

There are only artists\".[2] Gombrich later elaborated on this statement by saying that he defines \"art\" based on its Latin root, meaning \"skill\", and that there is \"no disembodied skill\".[11] Upon its release, The Story of Art was noted for its pedagogical potential[8][12] despite Gombrich's intentions of producing a pleasure read for teenagers.[12] The artist and art history professor H. W. Janson, reviewing the book for College Art Journal, remarked that it was \"undoubtedly destined for a most successful career in the classroom\".[8] He praised the book for its accessible language and selections free from Gombrich's own preferences, measuring the book against scholarly standards.[8] In his discussion of the book in The Burlington Magazine, the artist and writer Wilfrid Blunt noted that The Story of Art reads like a lecture.[12] Though he believed the lecture-like tone would lead masters to prefer the book rather than students, he declared that The Story of Art \"fully deserve[s] a place in any educational library\".[12] Criticism has also emerged since the book's release. One stream of criticism addresses Gombrich's treatment of contemporary art.[5][13][14] In a 1989 review for Art Journal of the book\u2019s 14th edition, the art history professor Bradford R. Collins criticised the work for its lack of depth in its discussion of contemporary art.[13] Collins indicated that Gombrich's commentary on 20th-century art was brief and often dismissive.[13] Elly Miller, daughter of B\u00e9la Horovitz, revealed in an interview that Gombrich had not originally intended to include an additional chapter on contemporary art and that \"he really didn't come to terms with what he called modern art\".[5] The art curator Karen Wilkin made similar comments for The Hudson Review, remarking of The Story of Art that \"[Gombrich] was never really at ease with anything but illusionistic painting and sculpture\".[14] Gombrich's omission of non-Western"

The name \"Koozie\", with a capital \"K\", is a federally registered trademark in the United States,[1] originally coined by Bob Autrey of San Antonio, Texas, and rights later sold to Radio Cap Corporation (RCC) as the KOOZIE in the early 1980s. The company RCC specialized in baseball caps before registering a trademark for the name KOOZIE in 1980, and subsequently introducing the product as a can cooler in 1982. As the promotional product industry grew, more products were added to the KOOZIE brand, including drinkware, more styles of can coolers, cooler bags, outdoor leisure items, travel accessories, and business accessories. The word koozie has also lost its trademark numerous times over the years, making it a regular everyday word in the English language, similar to words like onesie, zamboni, and hula hoop. These are brand name products that have been subject to genericide\u2014\"the process by which a brand name loses its distinctive identity as a result of being used to refer to any product or service of its kind.\"[2] Norwood Promotional Products acquired RCC in 1991 and continued to grow the KOOZIE line of products. In 2009, BIC Graphic purchased Norwood and its sub-brands. BIC Graphic dropped the \"RCC\" in favor of the KOOZIE brand name and expanded the line to include additional styles of can coolers, cooler bags and totes, as well as housewares.[3] Norwood was in a dispute, on-and-off over several years in the 2000s, over the Koozie trademark status with an online retail business called Kustom Koozies. Norwood asserts that names such as beer hugger, can cooler, and huggie do not infringe its trademark, but that koozie, coozie, coolie, and cozy do.[4][5] Kustom Koozies asserted in 2005 that the trademark had become generic.[4][5] In the years since, Norwood and Kustom Koozies came to a licensing agreement over the use of the trademark, but by 2009 they were in dispute again, as Kustom Koozies tried and failed to cancel the trademark licensing agreement in response to Norwood instructing it to make certain changes to its website, one of which was that \"Koozie\" should be set out in all-capital letters as \"KOOZIE,\" and another being that the registered trademark symbol \"\u00ae\" be used to identify genuine Norwood KOOZIE brand beverage sleeves.[6] In December 10 2025, a Newfane family business called \u2018 Better Wheel Workshops\u2019 which makes wooden can insulators originally known as the \u201cWoodzie\u201d settled a trademark dispute with the Koozie Group, which holds a trademark to the word \u201ckoozie\u201d, the conditions being that the \u201cWoodzie\u201d be renamed to \u201cTree Sleeves\u201d. Better Wheel Workshops has been making the wooden can insulators for a decade before they were informed about a year-and-a-half ago that the Koozie Group filed a petition with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to cancel the \u201cWoodzie\" trademark over potential confusion.[7] In Australia, the beverage insulator is called a stubby holder because local beer was traditionally sold in 375\u00a0mL (13.2\u00a0imp\u00a0fl\u00a0oz; 12.7\u00a0US\u00a0fl\u00a0oz) bottles colloquially known as \"stubbies\" due to their short, squat appearance in comparison to the alternative packaging of 750\u00a0mL (26\u00a0imp\u00a0fl\u00a0oz; 25\u00a0US\u00a0fl\u00a0oz) bottles (\"king brown\", \"tallie\", or simply \"bottle\"), and the 300 to 375\u00a0mL (10.6 to 13.2\u00a0imp\u00a0fl\u00a0oz; 10.1 to 12.7\u00a0US\u00a0fl\u00a0oz) longneck bottles commonly used for beer imported from North America and Europe. Most Australian domestic beers have now adopted longneck bottles and/or aluminium cans (\"tinnies\") for their 375\u00a0mL (13.2\u00a0imp\u00a0fl\u00a0oz; 12.7\u00a0US\u00a0fl\u00a0oz) packaging, and 750\u00a0mL (26\u00a0imp\u00a0fl\u00a0oz; 25\u00a0US\u00a0fl\u00a0oz) bottles are now sold much less commonly than was the case historically.  Victoria Bitter (VB) is notable for continuing to use the traditional stubby, albeit with a twist top replacing the traditional crown seal. Koozies are used to insulate a chilled beverage from warming by warm air, sunlight, and body heat. Using a koozie can reduce the rate a drink warms in the sun by up to 50%.[8] These items can also be used for easily identifying one's beverage from another person's and for marketing or for minimizing the condensation on the can. By imprinting on the koozie, many different companies have used the koozie as a promotional giveaway because it is not only inexpensive to manufacture, but its frequent use is more likely to bring the company's name to a household presence. Originally a logo or image was screen-printed on a round foam cylinder with a foam base, which generally has a hole at the base to ease inserting and removing beverage containers. The koozie has evolved in both material and style. Materials used include leather, neoprene, EVA, polyester, vinyl, and various open-cell and closed-cell foams.  There are koozies for 40 oz. bottles, and adjustable koozies that fit different beverage container sizes.",

        "text": "Chester Jermaine \"Lyfe\" Jennings (born June 3, 1978) is an American R&B and soul singer-songwriter, record producer, and instrumentalist.  He plays the guitar, bass, and piano which he integrates into his music. The New York Times referred to him as a \"socially minded R&B singer\".[1] Lyfe Jennings was born on June 3, 1978,[2][3] in Toledo, Ohio, to a working-class family and was the middle of five kids. When he was a teenager, Jennings started to perform with his brother and two cousins. In the beginning of the 1990s the group disbanded. During this time, Jennings began to get into legal trouble and his musical career came to a halt when he was sent to prison at the age of 14 for firebombing a house, killing a woman.[4][5] In October 2013, Jennings released Lucid. Tree of Lyfe, recorded primarily in his home studio, followed in June 2015.[6][7][8]  When asked about his current musical mindset,  Jennings stated: \"Everybody feels like they have to reinvent themselves. I don\u2019t think you can reinvent the truth. It is what it is. I\u2019m not focused on reinvention. I want to go deeper. This album reaffirms the reasons why people started loving this music in the first place.\"[9][10] Jennings was previously engaged to Joy Bounds, the mother of his two oldest children. In October 2008, Jennings, after arguing with Bounds, followed her to her family's house in Smyrna, Georgia. At the residence, he destroyed the door, fired shots in the street, and led police on a high-speed chase that ended when he crashed his 2005 Chevrolet Corvette. In September 2010, he was sentenced to three and a half years in prison after he pleaded guilty to multiple charges arising from the incident.[11][12] On February 2, 2016, he married Gwendolyn Scharkowski, a German model. They have a son. On March 15, 2017, Gwendolyn filed for divorce.[13]",

        "text": "The Honourable James Campbell (after c.\u20091660 \u2013 c.\u2009January 1713) of Burnbank and Boquhan[1] was a Scottish nobleman of Clan Campbell. He was an officer of the Royal Scots Army and then the British Army, and a politician who sat in the Parliament of Scotland from 1699 to 1702 and as a Whig in the British House of Commons from 1708 to 1710. He is also notable for an incident of bride kidnapping. In 1690 in London, 30-year-old Campbell abducted and married the 13-year-old granddaughter of an unamused Thomas, Lord Wharton. A notorious scandal ensued.[2] Campbell stole away to Scotland, evading punishment.[3] Campbell was the fourth son of Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll and his first wife Lady Mary, daughter of James Stuart, 4th Earl of Moray.[4] He was educated at the University of Glasgow.[4] During the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685, Campbell was held in preventive detention in Edinburgh Castle.[4] His father played a leading role in the rising, for which he was later executed.[5] Campbell joined the army in 1689 as a captain in his brother's regiment, the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot.[4] Scandal erupted in 1690 when Captain Campbell, aided by Sir John, son of Sir William of Johnston (who had served in King William's War and as a captain at the Battle of Boyne),[3] and by Archibald Montgomery, abducted and married a young heiress in London. The teenaged Mary Wharton was heir to her father Philip Wharton of Goldsborough Hall in North Yorkshire, who had died in 1685. On her 13th birthday, Mary had come into an annual income of \u00a31,500,[6] equivalent to \u00a3331,000 in 2023.[7] On 10 November 1690, Mary was lured outside from the home she shared with her great-aunt on Great Queen Street, Westminster, where the three men forced her into a six-horse coach and took her off to the coachman's house.[6] There, she was forcibly married to Campbell, without her consent, and without the presence of her legal guardian Robert Byerley, the son of her great-aunt.[6] By order of the Lord Chief Justice, the marriage was annulled and Mary was returned to her guardian within two days, to whom she was wed two years later.[4]\nSir John was then arrested and indicted for the abduction on 11 December, convicted by jury, and hanged at Tyburn on 23 December 1690.[6]  Reputedly a \"nasty piece of work\",[2] Johnston had previously been involved in a similar elopement with a Miss Magrath in County Clare, Ireland and had subsequently been imprisoned in Dublin as a debtor.[6] He was also alleged to have committed rape in Utrecht.[2] However, the real culprit was Campbell, who had lured the impoverished Johnston with money,[6] but escaped scot-free.[4]\nAbduction and forced marriage was an ancient custom in the Scottish Highlands,[8]\nbut in London Campbell was regarded as lucky to have escaped the hangman's noose.[2] The marriage was annulled on 20 December 1690 by the Parliament of England, which passed a personal Act of Parliament:[1]\nthe Mary Wharton and James Campbell Marriage Annulment Act 1690 (2 Will. & Mar. Sess. 2. c. 9).[9]\nCampbell's older brother, the 10th Earl of Argyll and later 1st Duke of Argyll, had unsuccessfully petitioned against the annulment.[6] In 1692, Mary was married to her guardian, Robert Byerley.[10]\nShe died in 1727, having had two sons and three daughters.[10]  Campbell remarried in 1694 to Margaret Leslie, daughter of General David Leslie, 1st Lord Newark. They had two sons and three daughters.[2] Campbell subscribed \u00a3500 to the Darien scheme in 1696. His relationship with his brother faltered during the 1690s, but had recovered sufficiently by 1699 that Campbell was elected in the Argyll interest to Parliament of Scotland, as a burgh commissioner for Renfrew.[1] In 1702 he became a director of the Bank of Scotland.[4] The first Duke of Argyll died in 1703, and was succeeded by his son John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll. At the 1708 British general election Campbell was chosen by his nephew, the second Duke,  as his candidate for the Ayr District of Burghs of Ayr, Irvine, Rothesay, Inveraray and Campbeltown.  The 1st Earl of Bute, who controlled Rothesay, acquiesced in the choice and made James Campbell a burgess of Rothesay to allow him to be appointed as the burgh's commissioner for the election. Argyll controlled Inverary and Campbeltown, so with three of five burghs backing James Campbell, a challenge would have been futile. He was returned unopposed as a Whig.[11] By the time of his election in 1708 Campbell had taken and then left another commission in the army, probably as colonel of a foot regiment. His  efforts in 1709 to secure reinstatement to the army failed, and neither appeals to the Duke of Marlborough nor the lobbying of his nephew Argyll were enough to win him a new commission. He was not prominent in Parliament but  supported Dr Sacheverell\u2019s impeachment in 1710.[4] Campbell gave up his Parliamentary seat at the 1710 general election, when his nephew gave the seat to the London-based Scottish physician Charles Oliphant.[11] Campbell probably died in January 1713, leaving two sons and two surviving daughters. His main heir was his eldest son John Campbell, although his younger son and a daughter were served as heirs to their portions of his estate in 1738.[4]",

She was elected in 2012, defeating incumbent Superintendent Tony Bennett. She was the first Democrat to serve in the office in 40\u00a0years and the first Democrat to win any down ballot race in the state since 1996.[3] She, along with Senator Joe Donnelly, are the most recent Democrats to been elected to statewide office in Indiana. On June 4, 2015, Ritz declared she would run for governor in 2016.[4][5][6] On August 7, 2015, Ritz announced that she would no longer seek the nomination for governor, but rather seek re-election for Superintendent of Public Instruction. Ritz was defeated by Republican challenger Jennifer McCormick. Glenda Sue Neubauer was born in 1954 in Lafayette, Indiana, to Mr. and Mrs. James L. Neubauer.[7][8][9] She graduated from Jefferson High School.[2][7] She holds bachelor's and master's degrees in education from Ball State University, and received a second master's degree in library science from Indiana University\u2013Purdue University Indianapolis.[2][7][10] She has been married to Gary Ritz of Pendleton, Indiana, since 1977.[2][11][7][9][12] The couple resides in Carmel, Indiana, and has two adult sons, named Brandon and Philip.[2][11][7][12] Before her statewide political career, Ritz was an educator and library media specialist for 33 years, and her last position was at the Crooked Creek Elementary School in Metropolitan School District of Washington Township.[2][11] She won teacher of the year awards at two different schools, and in 2012 she was one of 155 nationally board certified teachers in the state of Indiana.[11] She served as a member of the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, a board member of the Indiana State Teachers Association and president of the Washington Township local ISTA union, and president of the Washington Township Education Association for 15 years.[11] Originally a registered Republican, Glenda Ritz switched party registration in 2008 and ran as the Democratic nominee against first-term incumbent Tony Bennett to become the next Superintendent of Public Instruction in 2012.[2][1] Ritz was seen as an underdog with Bennett enjoying a substantial fundraising advantage and support of many prominent Republican officials.[1][13][14] She called the election a \"referendum\" on Bennett's tenure.[15][14] A member of the ISTA, Ritz had solid support from teachers and used that network and social media to expand her base.[1][11] She was endorsed by Democratic gubernatorial candidate John R. Gregg.[16] Ritz won the election in an upset, capturing 52 percent of the vote. Newly elected Governor Mike Pence received fewer votes than Ritz in the general election.[11][14] Indiana 2012 Superintendent of Public Instruction Election[13][17] Ritz was defeated in the 2016 general election by Republican nominee Jennifer McCormick.[18] Ritz took office on January 19, 2013.[3] As a member of the ISTA, she signed on to the 2011 court case against vouchers, but after her election in 2012, she removed her name so as not to have a conflict of interest in the case when she took office. The Indiana Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March 2013 that the vouchers were constitutional.[2][11][19][20] In one of his first acts as governor, Mike Pence removed Ritz from control of the Educational Employment Relations Board, which is in charge of handling conflicts between unions and school boards.[21] Later on, the CECI initiated a plan to remove Ritz from the state board of education by removing the superintendent as the chair.[11][20] In 2014, Indiana became the first state to pull out of the Common Core standards with the support of the state legislature, Gov. Pence, and endorsed by Ritz and the legislature authorized Ritz to oversee the development of new standards. Pence and Ritz were able to agree on the new standards.[22] New tests were created for those standards and also the federally mandated standards pushed by Pence, which resulted in 12-hours of standardized testing. Controversy developed over who was responsible for length of the testing time. The House agreed to reduce the test by a fourth and the Indiana Department of Education implemented the changes.[23][24][25][26] In 2014, Ritz also opposed the Republicans push to create a fast track for teacher certification saying that the standards for licensing should be kept rigorous. This was passed by the state legislature and signed by Gov. Pence.[10][27] On January 29, 2015, Indiana's House Education Committee voted in favor of allowing the State Board of Education to elect its own chair rather than be headed by the Superintendent of Public Instruction.[28] At the time, Ritz refused to speculate whether she would remain chair.[29] Ritz launched her gubernatorial race on June 4, 2015, following the announcements of John Gregg and Karen Tallian. At her announcement, Ritz said that education and the economy would be the centerpiece of her campaign platform.[4][5] Political pundits predicted that Ritz was expected to get the support of the ISTA, which is the teachers' union.[30]\nGlenda Ritz officially ended her gubernatorial campaign on August 7.[31]",

        "text": "On November 13, 1991, Patricia Allen, a 31-year-old lawyer, was murdered by her estranged husband, Colin McGregor, with a crossbow in downtown Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.[1] McGregor was found guilty of first degree murder and sentenced to life in prison. The murder received national media coverage because it was the first instance, in Canada, of spousal homicide using a crossbow, which was a way to get around gun ownership laws and restrictions, and acquire a deadly weapon (though there have been several similar crossbow crimes since then).[2] Patricia Allen, the only daughter of George and Maisie Allen, grew up with two brothers. Allen earned her bachelor's degree in philosophy at university in Ottawa.[3] Allen attended the McGill University Faculty of Law, where she graduated at the top her class in 1988[4] and won the prize for the highest achievement in civil law.[5][3] In 1989 she moved to Ottawa with McGregor, where she worked as a lawyer for Revenue Canada.[6][7] Colin McGregor (born in 1961) was the eldest of three boys of a Montreal business man, owner of a travel agency, and grew up in Westmount. He attended Westmount High School and at Marianopolis College he was valedictorian and student union president.[8][9][3][4] He played junior (U20) rugby with the Westmount Rugby Club and he was a champion debater at McGill University, having won the Princeton University Debate Tournament in 1982.[9][8] The pair met at McGill University while Allen was studying law and McGregor was studying philosophy. After graduation they married and moved to Ottawa.[3][4] Their relationship was described as rocky by family and friends, as they frequently fought and McGregor was perceived as jealous and possessive.[5] By 1990 they bought a home and Allen was working as a lawyer with Revenue Canada.[5][4][10] During this time McGregor bounced between jobs, working as a reporter in Halifax and Montreal, as a media spokesperson for the Canadian Pharmaceutical Association and in the federal government. In the fall of 1990, McGregor started a Master of Public Administration at Carleton University[3] while Allen supported him financially.[5] In the summer of 1991 he was able to secure a prestigious co-op position as an auditor at the Department of National Defence.[5] Later in 1990, when Allen was promoted to senior policy adviser on the Goods and Services Tax, McGregor (as he told a divorce lawyer) felt a shift in their relationship.[5][11] At that time McGregor started acting bizarrely, complaining about pains in his throat, liver, eyes, pancreas and brain.[5] He was convinced he was dying from a herpes infection, believing that swallowing a cold sore had triggered the dormant virus to spread throughout his body.[5][4] After visiting a number of specialists no physical aliment was discovered; on the contrary, the doctors suggested his complaints were psychological.[5] During this time neighbours heard the couple constantly arguing, often loudly.[5] He was admitted to a psychiatric ward for a week in the spring of 1991, and after his release his condition deteriorated and he stopped working at National Defence.[5][12] After threatening suicide in August 1991, McGregor was readmitted to the psychiatric ward for three weeks.[5][13][3] It was determined that his physical symptoms were the result of stress, and he was quite probably using them to control and manipulate others. Doctors noted McGregor was very angry, full of resentment and hostility towards people.[5] During his stay in the psychiatric ward, Allen told McGregor that she wanted a divorce.[5][11][3] Before the second week of September 1991, McGregor was discharged from the psychiatric ward and a close friend picked him up, with whom he lived for a short period.[5] He would frequently call friends and ramble on topics such as suicide, his recent separation, his ailments and how his situation was unfair.[5] After his release and up until her murder, McGregor harassed Allen incessantly.[3] He called her repeatedly and tried to enter their former matrimonial home without her permission.[3] During this time Allen kept a \"diary of threats\" and had a friend stay with her.[4] Leading up to the murder they met several times to divide their possessions as the divorce neared completion.[5] In October 1991, McGregor managed to enter the house through a bathroom window using a pair of garden shears.[5][12][4] On October 23, 1991, McGregor bought a crossbow and a pack of steel-tipped hunting bolts.[4] In the following weeks he would use the walls of his room as a target practice,[4] filling them with holes and continuing until the bolts were dull. A few days prior to the murder he bought a new set of bolts.[5] On the morning of November 13, 1991, Allen drove to a dentist appointment on Argyle Avenue in downtown Ottawa.[3][7] McGregor had been monitoring her movements and covertly followed her to the dentist's office. After Allen finished and was leaving McGregor got out of his vehicle and approached Allen while she was unlocking her vehicle, with a crossbow concealed by a garbage bag.[3][7] Surprised, she asked him why he was there, at which point McGregor shot her in the chest with a steel-tipped hunting bolt, killing her.[5][3][7] McGregor went to a police station shortly after the attack and confessed to killing his wife. During questioning, which began approximately 45 minutes after the incident, he admitted that he had intentionally killed her.[5][7] In his police interview, McGregor expressed extreme distress, stating that he felt suicidal and describing himself as \u201ca monster.\u201d He said he wanted to die and had previously considered killing both his wife and himself. He also disclosed that he believed he was terminally ill due to systemic herpes. McGregor further explained that he had purchased the crossbow with the original intention of using it to take his own life, noting that it was easier to obtain than a firearm.[5][7][3] After being charged with first degree murder and making an initial appearance in court, McGregor was sent to the Royal Ottawa Hospital for a 30-day psychiatric assessment.[14] He later pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.[12][13][4] During McGregor's trial it was discovered that he informed his psychiatrist, weeks before Allen's murder, that he had wanted to kill her.[8][13][4] In March 1993, Justice Louise Charron delivered her 149-page judgement rejecting McGregor's claim of insanity.[11] He was sentenced to life in prison. McGregor was released from prison after 29 years behind bars.[15] McGregor was sentenced to life imprisonment and served 29 years. He was granted day parole to a halfway house in 2020 and full parole in 2022. While incarcerated, he learned French and became a bilingual writer.[3] He contributed articles and maintained a blog for the online magazine The Social Eyes,[16] co-authored two books with Raymond Viger (including the Quebec Suicide Prevention Handbook),[17] and tutored other inmates. In one of his Social Eyes posts, he stated that prison had not made him bitter, citing his ability to help fellow prisoners, attend church services, and read extensively.[18] Regarding the murder of his wife, Patricia Allen, McGregor has written, \u201cI will never live down what I did.\u201d[18] In a later French-language interview (translated), he said: \u201cIt took me years to become aware of this, but I decided not to blame others and to look at myself in the mirror \u2026 I reflected on the crime, I committed the crime, and I am guilty.\u201d[19] McGregor has not publicly apologized for the killing. Patricia Allen's murder has a legacy that lives on today in several different ways and memorials. In 1992 a scholarships fund was created at Carleton University in her honour called the Patricia Allen Memorial Fund.[20] At first it started with private donations but later made use of other fundraising such as bingo nights and an annual golf tournament.[8] By 1996 it had raised over $220,000 CAD to fund scholarships for graduate students who conduct research into spousal violence.[21][8] Also in 1992 the McGill University Faculty of Law Class of 88 created an annual guest lecture in her honour named the Patricia Allen Memorial Lecture, which consists of a yearly lecture (or two) \"devoted to sensitizing and educating the legal community and others about pressing social and legal issues related to violence, especially against women.\"[6][22][23] In 1994, the Patricia Allen Memorial Fund supported a study with the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences to explore when would it be necessary for doctors to report threats made by their patients.[8] The results of the study assisted medical professionals to make several recommendations, such as compelling doctors to report their patient's serious threats concerning harming a person to the police or risk disciplinary action under professional misconduct regulations.[8] Patricia Allen's name is engraved on Enclave, a monument commemorating the lives of Ottawa women who were murdered by men from 1990 to 2000.[24]",

        "title": "Axes of subordination",
        "text": "In social psychology, the two axes of subordination is a racial position model that categorizes the four most common racial groups in the United States (Whites, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos) into four different quadrants.[1] The model was first proposed by Linda X. Zou and Sapna Cheryan in the year 2017, and suggests that U.S. racial groups are categorized based on two dimensions: perceived inferiority and perceived cultural foreignness.[1] Support for the model comes from both a target and perceivers perspective in which Whites are seen as superior and American, African Americans as inferior and American, Asian Americans as superior and foreign, and Latinos as inferior and foreign.[1] The United States is a country that was founded on slavery, the dispersion of Native Americans, and the holding of Mexican territories.[2][3] Even after slavery was abolished, the segregation of African Americans continued through Jim Crow laws and Black Codes.[3] The history of the United States led to a racial hierarchy in which Whites are at the top, and Blacks are at the bottom, with all other groups somewhere in between.[4] Although this Black-White model provides an explanation for inequality between White and Black Americans, it is not sufficient in explaining the disadvantage of other racial minorities such as Asian Americans and Latinos.[5] As the migration of immigrants to the United States became prominent, an increase of Latinos and Asian Americans in the country occurred. The Black-White model explaining racial hierarchy is no longer ideal as it fails to capture the variability of racial minorities. For example, racial minorities vary on numerous factors such as well-being, income, education, and forms of prejudice experienced.[6][7][8][1] The two-axes of subordination takes into consideration racial minority group variability through their two dimensions of perceived inferiority and perceived cultural foreignness. Although there are different racial hierarchies, there is a common idea behind all them. That is, the idea that some groups are better than others. It may seem counterintuitive to not treat every group as equal, but previous research demonstrates that there are multiple ways in which racial hierarchies are beneficial. Ultimately, racial hierarchies contribute to the overall success of an organization by allowing cooperation among groups and incentives for improvement among various other factors.[9] Even a hierarchy within groups is also beneficial as groups composed of members with different rankings can perform better on a interdependent task than groups composed of members of equal status.[10] Two important contributors to the study of group based hierarchies in social psychology are Jim Sidanius and Felicia Pratto. Both proposed social dominance theory in order to explain why societies build and maintain hierarchies on various factors such as race.[11] According to them, one way in which racial hierarchies are maintained is through hiearchy-enhancing legitimising myths, where in stable societies, justify the existing hierarchy.[12] Social dominance theory identifies other factors that help maintain hierarchies such as institutional discrimination, individual discrimination, and intergroup processes such as ingroup bias.[12]  Building off social dominance theory, social dominance orientation takes into consideration that individuals vary in terms of how much they support inequality among groups. Individuals who are high on social dominance orientation are supportive of hierarchy enhancing roles and ideologies.[13] The need for racial hierarchy is therefore present at both the group and individual level. It is well known that group hierarchies benefit those groups with power, but harm those groups who are considered minorities. Knowing this, it is odd that inferior groups justify the existing hierarchy by not fighting back. John T. Jost developed system justification theory to explain why minority groups justify their situation, and in some cases, look up to those who have the power.[14] The theory of system justification proposes that there are various psychological benefits to justifying the system, even among those who are considered to be a part of the minority group. The origin of system justification theory came from many other theories that include social identity theory, the belief in a just world, cognitive dissonance theory, marxist-feminist theories of ideology, and social dominance theory.[15] Individuals who are part of minority groups justify the existing system due to rationalization of the status quo, internalizing of inequality, the reduction of dissonance.[15] It seems that individuals would sometimes rather be stuck in certain discomfort than uncertain pleasantness. One dimension of the two axes of subordination racial position model is perceived inferiority. This category can be best defined as a group's socioeconomic status and racial groups can classify as either inferior or superior under this dimension.[1] The two axes of subordination categorizes White Americans as the superordinate group with the highest status.[1] The other dimension of the two axes of subordination racial position model is perceived cultural foreignness. Cultural foreignness gets at the idea that racial groups are perceived to differ in terms of how far away they are from the dominant group.[1] Since the two axes of subordination model focuses on U.S. racial relations, the dominant reference group is White Americans.[1] Racial groups can classify as either foreign or American under this dimension. Description: Since the two axes of subordination model focuses on U.S. racial relations, White Americans have the privilege of being high on both dimensions, making them superior and American. Across self reports of experiences of racial prejudice, Whites' most common answer was that they have not experienced racial prejudice and were the least likely to experience prejudice based on inferiority as well.[1] Support for the notion that Whites are high on both dimensions does not only come from self reports of Whites, but also from the perceptions of others. Across perceptions of White Americans from others, Whites are the racial group that are seen as the least inferior and foreign.[1] This perception that Whites are superior and American is nothing new. People associate being American as being White, and across the world, there is a view that leaders are White.[16][17] Being White is so powerful that even multiracials who have White ancestry are considered to be of higher status compared to multiracials that do not have White ancestry.[18] White Americans are in a great position as they are at the top, but it is also an interesting position to be in as they are motivated to stay there. Previous research demonstrates that amongst White Americans, prototypicality threat is reduced if outgroup assimilation is expected when confronted with the loss of a numerical majority.[19] Furthermore, White Americans who perceive a threat to the American culture are less likely to intertwine with growing racial minority groups.[20] As the migration of foreigners (specifically Latinos) to the U.S. continues through the years, it will be interesting to see if Whites are able to remain at the top. Description: In reference to the two axes of subordination model, Black Americans are low on the inferiority dimension, but high on the cultural foreignness dimension. It is important to remember that being high on cultural foreignness means that you deviate less from the superordinate group, which in this case, is White Americans. This makes Black Americans inferior, but American. Support for this notion comes from self reports of Black Americans who describe their experiences of racial prejudice as based on inferiority rather than from cultural foreignness.[1] From a perceiver's perspective, Black Americans are also perceived to be inferior and American, but not as American as Whites.[1] Although Black Americans are not seen as the same level of American as Whites, they are the only racial minority group, other than Native Americans, that are perceived to be American as opposed to foreign.[1] Because slavery of African Americans has a longstanding history in the United States, it is not surprising that Black Americans are considered American. Black Americans, through slavery, had a tremendous positive impact on the economy of North America.[21] Despite the civil rights movement and all of the modern day progress towards racial equality (e.g., affirmative action) in the United States, Black Americans are still considered inferior. A good indication of this is that there continues to be both a wage and academic gap among Black Americans in the U.S..[22][23] As American psychologist David O. Sears points out, there continues to be a boundary that restricts Black Americans from improving their position, this is known as Black exceptionalism.[24] Description: Asian Americans in the two axes of subordination model are high on the inferiority dimension, but low on cultural foreignness. This makes Asian Americans superior, but foreign. Out of the four major racial groups in the United States, Asian Americans are the only racial minority group to be considered superior. Support for this notion comes from the perspective of the target as well as perceivers.[1] Asian Americans are considered the model minority due to their ability to get into prestigious schools and attain great jobs.[25] The labeling of being the model minority has led Asian Americans to be positively stereotyped. A common belief that individuals hold about Asian Americans is that they are high academic achievers.[26] Although it may seem like a great thing to be stereotyped in a positive way, the labeling of Asian Americans as the model minority can have negative psychological consequences.[27][28] Despite Asian Americans being considered superior and the model minority, they are seen as foreign and continue to experience high amounts of racism.[29] In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, Asian American hate increased and was not uncommon.[30][31] So although Asian Americans are highly acknowledged in terms of their superiority, they are still targeted in terms of their foreignness. Description: Latinos are in an interesting quadrant in the two axes of subordination racial position model as they are low on both dimensions, making them inferior and foreign. In an interview of White Americans on attitudes toward Latinos, White Americans believe that Latinos are inferior because they have low paying jobs, live in poverty, and commit crime.[32] In Latinos' recall of their experience with racial prejudice, their responses indicate they are stereotyped based on beliefs of inferiority such as low education and class.[1] In addition to being inferior, Latinos are seen as foreign according to Latinos themselves and perceivers of the Latinos.[1] Being low on both dimensions of the racial position model is difficult as Latinos are a target of subordination on two dimensions as opposed to one in contrast to other racial minority groups (e.g., Asian Americans, Black Americans). So although Latino population continues to increase in the United States, their position in the racial position model is low on both dimensions.",

        "text": "Murphy's Law is an American hardcore punk band from New York City, formed in 1982. Vocalist Jimmy Drescher[1] remains the only founding member of the band, and the line-up has consisted of numerous musicians who have performed with a diverse selection of musical acts across multiple genres, such as Skinnerbox, Danzig, The Bouncing Souls, Mucky Pup, Dog Eat Dog, Hanoi Rocks, Fishbone, Agnostic Front, Warzone, the Cro-Mags, D Generation, New York Dolls, Joan Jett & the Blackhearts, The Slackers, Thursday, Skavoovie and the Epitones, White Trash and Glen Campbell. Over the course of their career, Murphy's Law has released five albums, the last of which, The Party's Over, was released in 2001. Murphy's Law's self-titled debut album was released in 1986. Their second album, Back with a Bong!, was released in 1989 on Profile Records,[2] and subsequently re-released on Another Planet Records in 1994, with the previous self-titled album on the same disc. The band underwent a transformation, with Jimmy Drescher being the only remaining member.[2] Alex Morris had been replaced on guitar by Todd Youth \u2013 previously of fellow New York City hardcore bands, Agnostic Front and Warzone, and later of Danzig. Chuck Valle replaced Pete Martinez on bass, and Doug E. Beans took over drumming duties from Petey Hines. In 1989, Murphy's Law opened for the Red Hot Chili Peppers on their Mother's Milk tour.[3] Stylistically, Murphy's Law made a jump on The Best of Times (1991). While the band dabbled in skacore long before it exploded, The Best of Times combined funk, reggae, ska, and hardcore. The album was produced by Fishbone's John \"Norwood\" Fisher and Philip \"Fish\" Fisher, containing guest instrumentation from several members of Fishbone. Dedicated was released by Another Planet on March 19, 1996.[2] The label had already picked up the rights to their previous material from Profile Records and in 1994 had released a split CD with the self-titled and Back with a Bong! albums on the same disc. Dedicated was produced by Daniel Rey, who also wrote \"Greenbud\" on the album. It follows 1993's Good for Now EP and the 1991 studio album The Best of Times. Dedicated was dedicated to former bass player, Chuck Valle, who was killed in a knife related incident in 1994.[2] His picture appears on the back page of the CD inlay and a picture of a tattoo inscribed with the words \"In Memory of Chuck\" appears on the jewel case inlay. The band did not record another album until The Party's Over in 2001,[4] but released singles, compilations, and split EPs with other bands in between. In 2002 Reflex/Wolfpack Records released a European vinyl pressing of The Party's Over. In 2002, the band appeared in Matthew Barney's film Cremaster 3 along with Agnostic Front.[5] In 2004, the song \"Vicky Crown\" appeared in a music video montage featuring Nick Mondo in the game Backyard Wrestling 2. In 2008, the song \"A Day in the Life\" was featured, as well as Jimmy G. himself as the DJ of Liberty City Hardcore (L.C.H.C)[6] radio station in the action videogame Grand Theft Auto IV. On April 12, 2010, Murphy's Law announced in a MySpace blog entry that they were working on a sixth studio album as well as a DVD and vinyl reissues of their back catalog.[7] On May 4, 2011, it was announced that Murphy's Law were signed to I Scream Records, who were scheduled to release the band's first studio album of original material since 2001's The Party's Over, as well as reissues of their back catalog. The reissued albums were released on CD, digital download, and vinyl in 2014 with previously unreleased bonus tracks. There had been no news or updates on new music from Murphy's Law until April 2025, when the band announced that they were in the studio recording a new album.[8] Their first song in 24 years, \"Go, Jimmy, Go!\", was released digitally as a single in October 2025.[9][10]",

        "text": "Strathearn School is an 11\u201318 girls' voluntary grammar school in Belfast, County Antrim, Northern Ireland. In 1864, 17 acres (69,000\u00a0m2) of land were bought by William Mullan and Robert Mullan, on which Strathearn House was built. In 1904, Mullan sold the house to Alexander Taylor, who died in October 1928. The house was then sold to the Victoria College girls' school, based in south Belfast, and which opened Strathearn School in 1929 to serve as a junior school, serving the Belmont and Knock areas. The initial enrolment was 63 pupils. Miss Miskelly, who taught classics at Victoria, became the first headmistress. At this time, the school was co-educational. Boys, however, left the school at age eight, with most moving to Cabin Hill boys' school, while the girls stayed until fourteen, after which they could move to Victoria. During the Second World War, the school was evacuated to the Argory, near Dungannon, and then to Portballintrae. In 1950, a separate Strathearn Committee of Victoria College was established and Strathearn adopted its own distinct uniform of green, fawn and wine. In 1952, Penrhyn House was bought and converted into a preparatory department. By 1980, there were 469 pupils in the secondary school; this grew to 759 by 1997. In 1987, the house beside was also bought to serve as another school building. In 1988, the control of the school by the founding Victoria College was relinquished and Strathearn School was established with its own board of governors.[2] The school was completely rebuilt in 2016. In 2018, the Chamber Choir became the Songs Of Praise Senior Young Choir Of The Year after coming runners-up in the old format in 2015. Strathearn School is affiliated with Campbell College, a boys' voluntary grammar school also on the Belmont Road. The school is divided into four houses: Each house was named after a school governor, introduced by Miss Rodden in 1944. Inter-house sports competitions and house plays are held annually.",

In 1864, 17 acres (69,000 m2) of land were bought by William Mullan and Robert Mullan, on which Strathearn House was built. In 1904, Mullan sold the house to Alexander Taylor, who died in October 1928. The house was then sold to the Victoria College girls' school, based in south Belfast, and which opened Strathearn School in 1929 to serve as a junior school, serving the Belmont and Knock areas. The initial enrolment was 63 pupils. Miss Miskelly, who taught classics at Victoria, became the first headmistress. At this time, the school was co-educational. Boys, however, left the school at age eight, with most moving to Cabin Hill boys' school, while the girls stayed until fourteen, after which they could move to Victoria. During the Second World War, the school was evacuated to the Argory, near Dungannon, and then to Portballintrae. In 1950, a separate Strathearn Committee of Victoria College was established and Strathearn adopted its own distinct uniform of green, fawn and wine. In 1952, Penrhyn House was bought and converted into a preparatory department. By 1980, there were 469 pupils in the secondary school; this grew to 759 by 1997. In 1987, the house beside was also bought to serve as another school building. In 1988, the control of the school by the founding Victoria College was relinquished and Strathearn School was established with its own board of governors.[2] The school was completely rebuilt in 2016. In 2018, the Chamber Choir became the Songs Of Praise Senior Young Choir Of The Year after coming runners-up in the old format in 2015.

In 1872 he was elected a member of the Norfolk, Virginia, city council. He was an AME minister at a number of churches and a leader in the Washington and Delaware Conferences of the church. John Hudson Riddick was born a slave on April 1, 1848, in Sunbury, North Carolina. He was owned by Rev. Isaac Riddick Hunter, and they moved to Norfolk, Virginia, in 1857.[1][2] When the American Civil War (1861\u20131865) started, Riddick served his master as a body servant. Later he left Hunter and served as a hospital steward for the 7th New York Independent Light Artillery until 1864. In 1864 he served at the custom-house in Norfolk under Major J. H. Hudson. When Hudson was removed after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by his successor President Andrew Johnson, Riddick moved to northeast Pennsylvania and began studying theology under Samuel G. Ortor. He then moved to Boston, Massachusetts, and continued to study theology and medicine,[1] and he graduated from Boston School of Theology.[3] In 1869 he returned to Virginia, where he practiced medicine for a short time. On July 4, 1869, he left medicine and became a minister. He served as a missionary under Bishop A. W. Waymen. In 1872 he was elected to the city council of Norfolk and appointed United States deputy marshal. He was later ordained by Bishop Edward Raymond Ames at Zoar M. E. Church in Philadelphia. Riddick was a respected leader in his community. By 1880 he had moved to Chestertown, Maryland, and he was a part of a push to hire black teachers for the black public schools in Baltimore in 1880.[4] He was active in support of the Maryland temperance campaign of Frances Harper and William Daniel.[5] and was chief in protest of the murders of African Americans in the Danville Massacre in 1883.[1] He was a pastor of churches at Chestertown, Maryland, of Zoar M. E. Church in Philadelphia, of Ezion Church in Wilmington, Delaware, and of Bainbridge Street Church in Philadelphia, where he finished his career, retiring in April 1893.[3] He also contributed to the journalism of the AME church, and was managing editor of the Conference Advocate and the Delaware Conference Bulletin. He was a prominent member of the Washington Conference and then the Delaware Conference of the AME church.[3] He was active in the Grand Army of the Republic, a Civil War veterans organization.[6] Riddick married Amelia A.[7] Riddick became sick from tuberculosis in April 1893.[3] Ridick died in Chester Heights, Pennsylvania, on August 5, 1893. His funeral was at the Bainbridge Street Methodist Episcopal Church and buried at Olive Cemetery.[8] He was survived by two children[3] and his wife, who died April 4, 1895.[7]",

        "text": "The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (German: Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr evolution\u00e4re Anthropologie, shortened to MPI EVA) is a research institute based in Leipzig, Germany, that was founded in 1997. It is part of the Max Planck Society network. Well-known scientists currently based at the institute include founding director Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo and Johannes Krause (genetics), Christophe Boesch (primatology), Jean-Jacques Hublin (human evolution), Richard McElreath (evolutionary ecology), and Russell Gray (linguistic and cultural evolution). The institute comprises six departments, several Research Groups, and The Leipzig School of Human Origins. Currently, approximately 375 people are employed at the institute.[1] The former department of Linguistics, which existed from 1998 to 2015, was closed in May 2015, upon the retirement of its director, Bernard Comrie. The former department of Developmental and Comparative Psychology operated from 1998 to 2018 under director Michael Tomasello.[2][3] In July 2006, the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and 454 Life Sciences announced that they would be sequencing the Neanderthal genome. Results of the study were published in the May 2010 journal Science detailing an initial draft of the Neanderthal genome based on the analysis of four billion base pairs of Neanderthal DNA. It was thought that a comparison of the Neanderthal genome and human genome would expand our understanding of Neanderthals, as well as the evolution of humans and human brains.[4] The study determined that some mixture of genes occurred between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans and presented evidence that elements of their genome remain in that of non-African modern humans.[5][6] DNA researcher Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo tested more than 70 Neanderthal specimens and found only one that had enough DNA to sample. Preliminary DNA sequencing from a 38,000-year-old bone fragment from a femur found in 1980 at Vindija Cave in Croatia shows that Neanderthals and Homo sapiens share about 99.5% of their DNA. It is believed that the two species shared a common ancestor about 500,000 years ago. The authors of the Nature article have calculated that the two species diverged about 516,000 years ago, whereas fossil records show a time of about 400,000 years ago. From DNA records, scientists hope to confirm or deny the theory that there was interbreeding between the species.[7] Dating carried out by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig revealed that the Jebel Irhoud site and its Homo sapiens fossils were far older than first thought. Fresh excavations revealed the remains of at least five people and a number of stone tools. The finds included part of a skull, a jawbone, teeth, and limb bones that had come from three adults, a juvenile, and a child aged about seven and a half years old.[8]\nThe bones looked similar facially to those of humans today, but had much larger lower jaws and elongated braincases. They have similar features to a skull dating to 260,000 years ago that was found at the other end of the continent, in Florisbad, South Africa, which has been attributed to Homo sapiens on the basis of the Jebel Irhoud finds.[9][8] The tools were found alongside gazelle bones and lumps of charcoal, indicating the presence of fire and probably of cooking in the cave. The gazelle bones showed characteristic signs of butchery and cooking, such as cut marks, notches consistent with marrow extraction, and charring.[10] Some of the tools had been burned due to fires being lit on top of them, presumably after they had been discarded. This enabled the researchers to use thermoluminescence dating to ascertain when the burning had happened, and by proxy, the age of the fossil bones, which were found in the same deposit layer. The burnt tools were dated to approximately 315,000 years ago, indicating that the fossils are of about the same age. This conclusion was confirmed by recalculating the age of the Irhoud 3 mandible, which produced an age range compatible with that of the tools, at roughly 280,000 to 350,000 years old. As of 2017, this would make the remains the earliest known examples of Homo sapiens.[11][12] This suggests that, rather than modern humans arising in East Africa approximately 200,000 years ago, it appears that humans may already have been present across the length of Africa 100,000 years earlier. According to Jean-Jacques Hublin, \"The idea is that early Homo sapiens dispersed around the continent and elements of human modernity appeared in different places, and so different parts of Africa contributed to the emergence of what we call modern humans today.\"[9] Early humans may have comprised a large, interbreeding population dispersed across Africa whose spread was facilitated by a wetter climate that created a \"green Sahara\", approximately 300,000 to 330,000 years ago. The rise of modern humans may thus have taken place on a continental scale, rather than being confined to a particular corner of Africa.[13] In 2005, the World Atlas of Language Structures, a project of the institute's former department of Linguistics, was published. The atlas consists of more than 140 maps, each displaying a particular language feature \u2013 for example order of adjective and noun \u2013 for between 120 and 1370 languages of the world. In 2008 the atlas was also published online and the underlying database made freely available. They also used to maintain the Glottolog until 2015, when it was taken over by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena. Researchers at the institute have developed a computer model analyzing early toddler conversations to predict the structure of later conversations. They showed that toddlers develop their own individual rules for speaking with slots into which they could put certain kinds of words. The rules inferred from toddler speech were better predictors of subsequent speech than traditional grammars.[14] 51\u00b019\u203214\u2033N 12\u00b023\u203240\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff51.32056\u00b0N 12.39444\u00b0E\ufeff / 51.32056; 12.39444",

The former department of Developmental and Comparative Psychology operated from 1998 to 2018 under director Michael Tomasello.[2][3] In July 2006, the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and 454 Life Sciences announced that they would be sequencing the Neanderthal genome. Results of the study were published in the May 2010 journal Science detailing an initial draft of the Neanderthal genome based on the analysis of four billion base pairs of Neanderthal DNA. It was thought that a comparison of the Neanderthal genome and human genome would expand our understanding of Neanderthals, as well as the evolution of humans and human brains.[4] The study determined that some mixture of genes occurred between Neanderthals and anatomically modern humans and presented evidence that elements of their genome remain in that of non-African modern humans.[5][6] DNA researcher Svante P\u00e4\u00e4bo tested more than 70 Neanderthal specimens and found only one that had enough DNA to sample. Preliminary DNA sequencing from a 38,000-year-old bone fragment from a femur found in 1980 at Vindija Cave in Croatia shows that Neanderthals and Homo sapiens share about 99.5% of"

Preliminary DNA sequencing from a 38,000-year-old bone fragment from a femur found in 1980 at Vindija Cave in Croatia shows that Neanderthals and Homo sapiens share about 99.5% of their DNA. It is believed that the two species shared a common ancestor about 500,000 years ago. The authors of the Nature article have calculated that the two species diverged about 516,000 years ago, whereas fossil records show a time of about 400,000 years ago. From DNA records, scientists hope to confirm or deny the theory that there was interbreeding between the species.[7] Dating carried out by the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig revealed that the Jebel Irhoud site and its Homo sapiens fossils were far older than first thought. Fresh excavations revealed the remains of at least five people and a number of stone tools. The finds included part of a skull, a jawbone, teeth, and limb bones that had come from three adults, a juvenile, and a child aged about seven and a half years old.[8] The bones looked similar facially to those of humans today, but had much larger lower jaws and elongated braincases. They have similar features to a skull dating to 260,000 years ago that was found at the other end of the continent, in Florisbad, South Africa, which has been attributed to Homo sapiens on the basis of the Jebel Irhoud finds.[9][8] The tools were found alongside gazelle bones and lumps of charcoal, indicating the presence of fire and probably of cooking in the cave. The gazelle bones showed characteristic signs of butchery and cooking, such as cut marks, notches consistent with marrow extraction, and charring.[10] Some of the tools had"

The gazelle bones showed characteristic signs of butchery and cooking, such as cut marks, notches consistent with marrow extraction, and charring.[10] Some of the tools had been burned due to fires being lit on top of them, presumably after they had been discarded. This enabled the researchers to use thermoluminescence dating to ascertain when the burning had happened, and by proxy, the age of the fossil bones, which were found in the same deposit layer. The burnt tools were dated to approximately 315,000 years ago, indicating that the fossils are of about the same age. This conclusion was confirmed by recalculating the age of the Irhoud 3 mandible, which produced an age range compatible with that of the tools, at roughly 280,000 to 350,000 years old. As of 2017, this would make the remains the earliest known examples of Homo sapiens.[11][12] This suggests that, rather than modern humans arising in East Africa approximately 200,000 years ago, it appears that humans may already have been present across the length of Africa 100,000 years earlier. According to Jean-Jacques Hublin, \"The idea is that early Homo sapiens dispersed around the continent and elements of human modernity appeared in different places, and so different parts of Africa contributed to the emergence of what we call modern humans today.\"[9] Early humans may have comprised a large, interbreeding population dispersed across Africa whose spread was facilitated by a wetter climate that created a \"green Sahara\", approximately 300,000 to 330,000 years ago. The rise of modern humans may thus have taken place on a continental scale, rather than being confined to a particular corner of Africa.[13] In 2005, the World Atlas of Language"

The atlas consists of more than 140 maps, each displaying a particular language feature \u2013 for example order of adjective and noun \u2013 for between 120 and 1370 languages of the world. In 2008 the atlas was also published online and the underlying database made freely available. They also used to maintain the Glottolog until 2015, when it was taken over by the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History in Jena. Researchers at the institute have developed a computer model analyzing early toddler conversations to predict the structure of later conversations. They showed that toddlers develop their own individual rules for speaking with slots into which they could put certain kinds of words. The rules inferred from toddler speech were better predictors of subsequent speech than traditional grammars.[14] 51\u00b019\u203214\u2033N 12\u00b023\u203240\u2033E\ufeff / \ufeff51.32056\u00b0N 12.39444\u00b0E\ufeff / 51.32056; 12.39444"

The facility consists of 2 coal-fired steam generating units generating a total capacity of 116 MW.[1] The units can use fuel oil as an alternate energy source.[2] Condenser cooling for these units is accomplished with once-through cooling water from the Potomac River.[3] The plant is located on land in between the Potomac River and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, north of Lock 44 of the canal. Coal was delivered to the plant originally by rail until the mid-1950s, and intermittently by rail and trucks until late 1974 when all coal deliveries were diverted to trucks.[4] Coal ash from the plant was disposed at ash ponds in West Virginia, across the river from the plant.[5] The plant is subject to the federal Clean Air Act. Because of the age of the power plant units, and the need to maintain the plant's capabilities to ensure reliability of the regional power grid, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) had exempted the plant from compliance with a state law, the Healthy Air Act, which sets stringent air pollution limits for sulfur oxide and NOx.[5] However, FirstEnergy decided to cease plant operations in 2012, and in 2013 MDE proposed reinstating the stringent state emission requirements, in case the plant resumes operations in the future.[6] Construction of the first power plant at Williamsport began in 1922 by the Potomac Public Service Company. In 1923 the company became part of the Potomac Edison Company, and in 1925 Potomac Edison joined West Penn Electric Company. The first generating unit began service in 1927.

Circa 1970 the plant began to receive coal deliveries by truck, and rail deliveries ended.[7] On January 26, 2012 parent company FirstEnergy announced that the station would be closed due to the cost of retrofitting the plant to comply with environmental regulations due to take effect in 2015.

        "text": "Last Evenings on Earth (Llamadas Telefonicas in Spanish) is a collection of short stories by the Chilean author Roberto Bola\u00f1o, published in 1997[1] with a translation into English by Chris Andrews published in 2006. The stories in this volume were selected from two Spanish-language collections, Llamadas Telefonicas (1997) and Putas Asesinas (2001). The remaining stories in these two collections were later gathered in The Return. Set amid the diaspora of Chilean exiles in Latin America and Europe, the fourteen stories in Last Evenings on Earth are peopled by Bola\u00f1o's beloved \"failed generation\" and demonstrate the complexities of Latin American identity and history. The narrators are usually writers grappling with private (and often unlucky) quests, speaking in the first person as if giving a deposition\u2014like witnesses to a crime. These protagonists tend to take detours and narrate unresolved efforts. They are characters living at the margins. Other stories find themselves narrated in the third person by the author \"B.\", which is one of many cases of Bola\u00f1o writing himself into his own fiction. The unnamed narrator comes in fourth in a short story contest. In the collection of finalists, he reads a story by Luis Antonio Sensini. He begins a correspondence with the much-older writer. When Sensini moves back to Argentina, the two stop writing each other. After Sensini dies, his daughter Miranda visits the narrator. The author B writes a book which includes a mocking portrayal of another, and far more famous, author \u2013 A. To B's surprise, A writes a positive review of B's book, and B is left to wonder the possible implications of this. After a second book by B receives a long, considered and insightful review by A, B decides that he has to meet him. Seventeen-year-old Arturo Belano spends his days in Mexico City browsing bookstores and watching movies. He strikes up an odd friendship with a man, whom he calls \"the grub\" (\"El Gusano\"), who sits on the same bench every day, doing nothing. The character of the grub, \"with his straw hat and a Bali cigarette hanging from his bottom lip\",[2] is also the subject of Bola\u00f1o's poem of the same name (\"El Gusano\" in Spanish, though translated as \"the Worm\" rather than \"the Grub\" in Laura Healy's translation of The Romantic Dogs).

                "text": "Last Evenings on Earth (Llamadas Telefonicas in Spanish) is a collection of short stories by the Chilean author Roberto Bola\u00f1o, published in 1997[1] with a translation into English by Chris Andrews published in 2006. The stories in this volume were selected from two Spanish-language collections, Llamadas Telefonicas (1997) and Putas Asesinas (2001). The remaining stories in these two collections were later gathered in The Return. Set amid the diaspora of Chilean exiles in Latin America and Europe, the fourteen stories in Last Evenings on Earth are peopled by Bola\u00f1o's beloved \"failed generation\" and demonstrate the complexities of Latin American identity and history. The narrators are usually writers grappling with private (and often unlucky) quests, speaking in the first person as if giving a deposition\u2014like witnesses to a crime. These protagonists tend to take detours and narrate unresolved efforts. They are characters living at the margins. Other stories find themselves narrated in the third person by the author \"B.\", which is one of many cases of Bola\u00f1o writing himself into his own fiction. The unnamed narrator comes in fourth in a short story contest. In the collection of finalists, he reads a story by Luis Antonio Sensini. He begins a correspondence with the much-older writer. When Sensini moves back to Argentina, the two stop writing each other. After Sensini dies, his daughter Miranda visits the narrator. The author B writes a book which includes a mocking portrayal of another, and far more famous, author \u2013 A. To B's surprise, A writes a positive review of B's book, and B is left to wonder the possible implications of this. After a second book by B receives a long, considered and insightful review by A, B decides that he has to meet him. Seventeen-year-old Arturo Belano spends his days in Mexico City browsing"

After a second book by B receives a long, considered and insightful review by A, B decides that he has to meet him. Seventeen-year-old Arturo Belano spends his days in Mexico City browsing bookstores and watching movies. He strikes up an odd friendship with a man, whom he calls \"the grub\" (\"El Gusano\"), who sits on the same bench every day, doing nothing. The character of the grub, \"with his straw hat and a Bali cigarette hanging from his bottom lip\",[2] is also the subject of Bola\u00f1o's poem of the same name (\"El Gusano\" in Spanish, though translated as \"the Worm\" rather than \"the Grub\" in Laura Healy's translation of The Romantic Dogs).

        "text": "National Coming Out Day (NCOD) is an annual LGBTQ awareness day observed on October 11 to support anyone \"coming out of the closet\".[1] First celebrated in the United States in 1988, the initial idea was grounded in the feminist and gay liberation spirit of the personal being political, and the emphasis on the most basic form of activism being coming out to family, friends, and colleagues, and living life as an openly LGBTQIA+ person.[2] The founders believed that homophobia thrives in an atmosphere of silence and ignorance and that once people know that they have loved ones who are LGBTQIA+, they are far less likely to maintain homophobic or oppressive views.[3] NCOD was inaugurated in 1988 by Robert Eichberg and Jean O'Leary. Eichberg, who died in 1995 of complications from AIDS, was a psychologist from New Mexico and the founder of the personal growth workshop \"The Experience\".[4] O'Leary was an openly lesbian political leader and long-time activist from New York and was at the time the head of the National Gay Rights Advocates in Los Angeles.[3] LGBT activists, including Eichberg and O'Leary, did not want to respond defensively to anti-LGBT action because they believed it would be predictable. This led them to establish NCOD to maintain positivity and celebrate coming out.[1] The date of October 11 was chosen because it is the anniversary of the Second National March on Washington for Lesbian and Gay Rights in 1987.[1] Most people think they don't know anyone gay or lesbian, and in fact, everybody does. It is imperative that we come out and let people know who we are and disabuse them of their fears and stereotypes. Initially administered from the West Hollywood offices of the National Gay Rights Advocates, the first NCOD received participation from eighteen states, garnering national media coverage. In its second year, NCOD headquarters moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and participation grew to 21 states. After a media push in 1990, NCOD was observed in all 50 states and seven other countries. Participation continued to grow, and in 1990, NCOD merged its efforts with the Human Rights Campaign.[1] In the United States, the Human Rights Campaign manages the event under the National Coming Out Project, offering resources to LGBT individuals, couples, parents, and children, as well as straight friends and relatives, to promote awareness of LGBT families living honest and open lives. Candace Gingrich became the spokesperson for the day in April 1995. To celebrate National Coming Out Day on 11 October 2002, Human Rights Campaign released an album bearing the same title as that year's theme: Being Out Rocks. Participating artists include Kevin Aviance, Janis Ian, k.d. lang, Cyndi Lauper, Sarah McLachlan, and Rufus Wainwright. National Coming Out Day is observed annually to celebrate coming out and to raise awareness of the LGBT community and civil rights movement. The first decades of observances were marked by private and public people coming out, often in the media, to raise awareness and let the mainstream know that everyone knows at least one person who is lesbian or gay.[1] The day has been more of a holiday in recent years because coming out as LGBT is far less risky in most Western countries. Participants often wear pride symbols such as pink triangles and rainbow flags.[citation needed] National Coming Out Day is also observed in Ireland,[5] Switzerland, the Netherlands, United Kingdom,[6] and Portugal.[7] In the United States, the Human Rights Campaign sponsors NCOD events under the auspices of their National Coming Out Project, offering resources to LGBT individuals, couples, parents, and children, as well as straight friends and relatives, to promote awareness of LGBT families living honest and open lives. Candace Gingrich became the spokesperson for NCOD in April 1995.[1] From 1999 to 2014, the Human Rights Campaign announced a theme to go with each NCOD:[1] Radical feminist poet and author Adrienne Rich, in her 1980 essay \"Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence\", suggests that the need to come out stems from the pressure to adhere to heterosexuality from birth, or compulsory heterosexuality.[8] Rich uses the example that heterosexual people never have to come out as heterosexual, and that societal support of heterosexuality as the norm leads to homosexuality being viewed as an anomaly. She explores how the oppressive, ubiquitous nature of compulsory heterosexuality has historically resulted in many lesbians never realizing their true nature or not discovering their orientation until later in life.[8] NCOD has traditionally been a celebratory day for the LGBT community. However, Preston Mitchum, a black queer writer, in his article, \"On National Coming Out Day, Don't Disparage the Closet\", published in The Atlantic in 2013, questions the assumptions that he believes NCOD makes. While Mitchum does not discredit those who have come out and praises them for their bravery, he also points out that coming out may not always be safe for LGBT people in multiple marginalized communities.[9] Mitchum also suggests that coming out can lead to hypervisibility for those with intersecting identities, potentially leading to discrimination in the workplace, family exile, violence, and criminalization.[9]",

Brennan's was founded in 1946 by Owen Brennan, an Irish-American restaurateur and New Orleans native. It was originally called the Vieux Carr\u00e9 restaurant and was located on Bourbon Street across from the Old Absinthe House. Bananas Foster was created at this location.[1] In 1956, Brennan's moved to its current location. This building, a two-story French Quarter mansion at 417 Royal Street constructed in 1795, was built for Don Jos\u00e9 Faurie and later housed the Banque de la Louisiane, the first bank in Louisiana. From 1841 to 1891, the mansion had been owned by the Morphy family, with Paul Morphy, the celebrated chess player and unofficial world chess champion, living there until his death in 1884. In 1920 William Ratcliffe Irby gave the building to Tulane University[2]  and it was initially leased by Owen Brennan in 1954 to open the following year as Brennan's. The restaurant purchased the building in 1984.[3] Because Brennan's father owned a share of the restaurant, the restaurant was eventually inherited by Brennan's siblings as well as his children. In 1973, disagreement within the Brennan family over the expansion of the restaurant line led to a split into several different corporations, with the original New Orleans restaurant being wholly owned by Brennan's widow and children, and other restaurants in New Orleans, Houston, and Dallas, the Brennan Family Restaurants, being owned by Brennan's siblings and their children. Although the section of Royal Street in the French Quarter was spared the flooding suffered by most of the city in the levee failures during Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Brennan's did suffer significant damage, largely due to the contents of second-story refrigerators melting and seeping onto lower floors. The restaurant's extensive wine cellar lost temperature control, ruining the entire wine collection. Following an extensive renovation, Brennan's re-opened on June 8, 2006. Brennan's closed on June 28, 2013.[4] The new owners of Brennan's, Terry White and Ralph Brennan (a cousin of the former owners) purchased the building and the business at auction(s) after the former owners ran into financial trouble.  For more than a year, the historic building underwent an extensive renovation.[5] The new Brennan's was unveiled in the fall of 2014.

        "text": "Ciccaba nigrolineata (Sclater, 1859) The black-and-white owl (Strix nigrolineata) is a species of owl in the family Strigidae.[1][3] The black-and-white owl is a medium-sized owl with a round head and no ear tufts. It is between 35 and 40\u00a0cm in length and weigh between 400 and 535 grams. As for most owl species, females are usually bigger than males with an average weight of 487 g and 418 g respectively.[4] It has a striped black-and-white breast, belly, and vent. With the exception of a black-and white striped collar, the upperparts from the crown to the tail are a sooty black. The facial disc is mostly sooty black, with white \"eyebrows\" that extend from the bill to the collar. The beak is a yellow-orange colour, and the eyes are a reddish brown.[5] Chicks are downy and white. Juveniles have a whitish face, dark brown upper-parts and a white-barred black underside.[6] Formerly under the genus Ciccaba which includes many neotropical species, the black-and-white owl is now classified under the genus Strix known as the \"wood owls\", which all share the same round head and pitch black eyes.[4] This raptor was first reported in 1859 by Sclater. Its sister species, the black-banded owl (Strix hulula), while being similar, is smaller and has a darker plumage. Plus, it occupies a different range which includes the southern tropical forests of South America.[7][4] The black-and-white owl is mostly found in gallery forests and rainforest, but is also found in wet deciduous and mangrove forests, usually at an altitude between sea level and 2400 meters.[5] Small ponds are also often visited by this species when hunting. It usually nests in the foliage of large, tall trees such as mahogany.[4][8] This owl is not afraid of living near human habitations.[5] Its range extends from central Mexico south to the northwestern section of Peru and western Colombia, a range it partially shares with another related species: the mottled owl (Strix virgata).[8][5] In total, it is found in 12 countries: Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.[1] This bird of prey also stays faithful to its range all year long as it is a non-migratory bird.[4] This neotropical bird is a nocturnal hunter and since most of its prey can fly, it forages mostly at the canopy level of its habitat. It will first examine its surroundings by perching on an elevated branch. Then it will make short, silent flights to catch its food.[9][10] Primarily insectivorous, the black-and-white owl prefers scarab beetles (Scarabaedidae) such as dung beetles and sometimes prey upon orthopterans and cicadas (Cicadidae).[9][10] Bats such as the Jamaican fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) and other small rodents also make up a large part of its diet. Furthermore, it can occasionally feed on smaller birds like thrushes and tanagers as well as amphibians.[7][9][10] It is also one of the only tropical owl species reported to capture barn swallows since those are easy to catch when roosting on nearby electric lines.[11] Its call consists of a series of rapid, guttural, low calls, followed by a short pause and a low, airy call and a faint, short hoot. Occasionally, it is shortened to just the last two notes, leaving out the opening series.[5] Moreover, the female's call usually sounds louder than the male's and individuals make fainter \"hoots\" near their nest. Just like their parents, younglings can produce strident cries, but also communicate by clacking their beak.[4] When the breeding season begins in March, the monogamous pair forms after the male successfully seduces the female with wing flaps and elaborated acrobatic flights.[6][8] Then, before the severe downpours begin, the couple settles on an isolated tree to protect their offspring from climbing predators and use epiphytes and flower arrangements (e.g., orchids) as their nest.[4][8] While the female incubates the clutch of one or two eggs, the male goes foraging for the pair and fiercely defends the nest, even from nearby humans. Sometimes, the female will tag along with her mate when she is not coveting.[6][8][9] The eggs are dull, whitish and weight about 33.8 g (usually 6% of the female's body mass) with an average length and width of 46.4 and 38.4\u00a0mm (1.83 and 1.51\u00a0in) respectively.[4][12] The black-and-white owl is one of the only owls to lay a single egg which relates to the fact that clutch size lowers as a species lives closer to the Equator, thus explaining its low reproductive success.[8] After an incubation period of at least 30 days, the chicks hatch in April.[4][8] They harbour white down feathers, pink feet and beak and weight around 28 g after 2 days. They first open their eyes at 14 days old as the black bars on their wings start to develop. Chicks also have a low chance of survival as they can be preyed upon by tayras, ocelots, coatis, falcons and hawks.[4] The black-and-white owl is classified as \"Least Concern\" on IUCN's Red List even if its populations are decreasing.[13] Mexico's population in particular observed a decline of 50% in the last century which has made the species a big concern for the Partners in Flight association.[7] This bird of prey's main threat is the loss of its wetland and forest habitats which are progressively converted into agricultural lands.[4][7] Human proximity also causes their populations to decrease.[4]",

The district headquarters is Dehradun, which has also served as the interim capital of Uttarakhand since its founding in 2000. The district has 6 tehsils, 6 community development blocks, 17 towns and 764 inhabited villages, and 18 unpopulated villages. The district stretches from the Ganges river in the east to the Yamuna river in the west, and from the Terai and Shivaliks in the south and southeast to the Great Himalaya in the northwest. During the days of British Raj, the official name of the district was Dehra Dun.[5] In 1842, Dun was attached to Saharanpur district and placed under an officer subordinate to the Collector of the district but since 1871 it is being administered as separate district. Dehradun district's Jaunsar-Bawar is culturally part of the historical Mahasu region.[6] Dehradun is located 230\u00a0km from the national capital, Delhi. The National Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Survey of India, and many educational institutions like Doon University, Uttrakhand Technical Institute, Indian Institute of Petroleum, Uttaranchal University, Forest Research Institute, Wildlife Institute of India, Rashtriya Indian Military College and Indian Military Academy are also situated here. Basmati rice, tea and litchi orchards are some of the major agricultural crops. The region was seized as a war spoil from the Maharaja of Tehri-Garhwal as a consequence of the Gurkha War of 1814\u201316, and attached administratively to Saharanpur District to its immediate south, which was already in British hands. Dehradun includes various Puranic stories and cultures. It is mentioned in the Ramayana that Lord Rama, along with brother Lakshmana, came to the area after defeating Ravana, the Rakshasa king of Lanka. The area is also linked to Dronacharya, the guru of the Kauravas and Pandavas in the Mahabharata. The area of Rishikesh is mentioned in the Skanda Purana as having been given to rishis (sages) by Lord Vishnu after killing the asuras Madhu-Kaitabha and their companions who tormented the rishis. Ancient temples, statues and archaeological remains have been found at the sites in and around the area that are mentioned in the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. These remains have been dated to be approximately 2000 years old. The location of the area, the ancient traditions and customs still followed here, folk songs coming down from generations, and their contemporaneous literature point to the fact that the area witnessed various events during the periods of the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. The Pandavas held influence over the region after the battle of the Mahabharata and the area was ruled by the descendants of Subahu as administrators under the Kuru kingdom at Hastinapura. The discovery of Ashokan edicts at Kalsi near Dehradun show that the area was quite prosperous. Huen Tsang also observed Kalsi as Sudhanagara in the 7th century AD. Archaeological remains from the time of Raja Rasal have been found at Haripur near Kalsi. The area was attacked by Mahmud Ghaznavi, Timur in 1368. Guru Ram Rai, the errant eldest son of the seventh Guru of the Sikhs, Guru Har Rai, established his 'Dera' (camp) in the Dun Doon Valley around 1676 and the town that grew around this 'Dera' has come to be known as 'Dehradun'. He founded his own Udasi Panth (sect) and received support from Aurangzeb. Rohilla chieftain Najib ad-Dawlah in 1757 and Ghulam Kadir in 1785. This kept the area in disarray till 1801. The British captured the area in 1816 and founded the cities of Landour and Mussourie in 1827\u201328. The district was added to the Garhwal division in the 1970s. It was established as the capital of Uttarakhand after the establishment of the state as Uttaranchal in the year 2000. This State Founded in the mid-15th century by Phoda Singh and Lal Karan Singh, members of the ''Chokker'' family of Hindus, the state remained under the rule of this dynasty until its eventual annexation.[7][8] In 1548, two prominent Chhokar chieftains, Phoda Singh and Lal Karan, from the Titron region in Saharanpur district, crossed the Sivalik hills, conquered the entire Dehradun area, and established the Timli state. They also founded a town named Timli.[9][10] Bhagwan Singh was the majestic king of the Chhokar family of Timli. He had the status of a magistrate and he used to fix the prices of agricultural products of north india.[11] When the British Raj entered this area under the Arazi-i-Bandobasti land settlement, they took control of the area around Dehradun, while the rest of the state remained under local rule. By 1830, Bhagwan Singh was the king of Timli state. His only descendant, a daughter named Satyaditi, became the ruler after him.[12][9] Raja Ranjit Singh  of Samthar state, born in 1943, was married at a young age to a princess from the Chhokar family, which ruled Timli state in Dehradun.[13][8] [needs update]As of the 2011 Census of India, Dehradun district has highest population (1,698,560) in Uttarakhand.[16] The Decadal growth rate has jumped up from 25% (1991\u20132001) to 32.48% (2001\u20132011).

This has however improved from 887 in the 2001 census. The population density is 550, again the 3rd highest after Haridwar(817) and Udham Singh Nagar (648). The state average is 189. The literacy rate is the highest in the state at 85.24% (90.32 for males, 79.61 for females)[17] According to the 2011 census Dehradun district has a population of 1,698,560,[16] roughly equal to the nation of Guinea-Bissau[18] or the US state of Idaho.[19] This gives it a ranking of 290th in India (out of a total of 640).[16] The district has a population density of 550 inhabitants per square kilometre (1,400/sq\u00a0mi).[16] Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 32.48%.[16] Dehradun has a sex ratio of 902 females for every 1000 males,[16] and a literacy rate of 85.24%.

Dehradun finds itself split across two central electoral constituencies- Tehri Garhwal (including Mussoorie) and Pauri Garhwal (including Haridwar and Rishikesh).",

Dehradun finds itself split across two central electoral constituencies- Tehri Garhwal (including Mussoorie) and Pauri Garhwal (including Haridwar and Rishikesh)."

        "text": "Martin Motnik  (born 10 November 1972) is a German-American[1] bassist, best known as the bassist for the heavy metal band Accept. He has also played in Darkseed and Eisbrecher. Motnik has made two solo albums that include instrumental songs varying in styles from melodic rock, jazz, and classical music. Motnik was born in Ludwigshafen, Germany on 10 November 1972. At the age of six, he started playing the flute but was not particularly interested in it. His parents agreed to buy him an acoustic guitar a couple of years later. At the age of ten, he switched to playing the electric guitar, and at the age of 13, encouraged by his older brother Frank, the bass guitar. After getting a bass guitar, he got inspired to play, and started practicing daily by studying bass players such as John Entwistle (The Who), Billy Sheehan (David Lee Roth band),  Geddy Lee (Rush). Motnik has named them his biggest influences and role models.[2][3][4] At the age of 16, Motnik started playing in bands, and in the following years, he played in several bands in the Mannheim-Heidelberg area. At this point, he was not yet ready to commit fully to a musical career. First, he worked in a bank, and afterward, he completed an MBA at university. After graduating in 2003, he decided to pursue music full-time. Motnik moved to Munich for better opportunities to focus professionally on a musical career.[2][4] After moving to Munich, Motnik joined the German goth metal band Darkseed in 2003. He plays on the band's 2005 album Ultimate Darkness. Darkseed announced in August 2006 that singer Stefan Hertrich and bassist Motnik would leave the band and focus on their other projects.[5][6][7][8] In the same year, both participated in the Atargatis band's album \"Wasteland\" recording.[9] In 2005 Motnik joined the hard rock band The Roxx. He plays on the band's Unleash Your Demon, released in 2007, and on the live recording The Roxx Unleash The Demon.[10][11][12][13] At the same time, he was also a member of the German Neue Deutsche H\u00e4rte band Eisbrecher and played bass on the band's tours.[4][14] In 2008 Motnik moved to Los Angeles, US. Ecotonic was the first band Motnik joined there. The band toured in Southern California and made the album When Sparks Fly with Motnik in 2010. Only shortly after moving to the US, Motnik joined Uli Jon Roth's (Scorpions) North American tour as a bassist. This encouraged him to continue his career in the US. Later, in 2009 and 2012, Motnik played again with Uli Jon Roth on his North American tours.[2][15][16][17][4] In 2010 Motnik moved to Las Vegas and played as a professional musician in casinos. He worked for Carnival Cruise Lines from 2014 to 2018, first as a bassist and later on as musical director. As a session musician, the playlist often featured various theme nights from Motown to country music, rhythm and blues, disco, jazz and Latin American music, which expanded Motnik's musical repertoire.[18][2] Motnik started playing as a studio musician already in the 1990s. He plays on Dan Lucas's album News, among others. After moving to Las Vegas, he started a site that makes it easy to work with other musicians worldwide.[19] Motnik has worked as a studio musician with several artists playing many different styles, such as The Wrecking Crew's Hal Blaine (drums) and Don Rand (piano), Gregg Bissonette, Phil Campbell, Paul Sabu and Bruce Kulick, and Ralf Scheepers.[3][20][21][22]\nMotnik has said that he enjoys as much working in the studio as in live concerts: \"My best days are when I have spent the day working in the studio, and at night I am playing a gig. That's when both my desires are being fulfilled, my passion to record and my love to play out live and interact with other musicians and the audience.\"[23] He continues as a studio musician after joining Accept.[24] In February 2019, shortly after Peter Baltes had left Accept, Motnik moved to Nashville. He contacted the band, and after a while, he got an answer from Wolf Hoffmann, who invited him to a jam session. In April 2019, Accept announced that Martin Motnik had replaced Baltes as bassist. He joined the band just before the Symphonic Terror tour, and Motnik had a week and a half to learn the 22 songs.[4][14][25] Too Mean to Die is the first Accept album that Motnik plays. He did compose songs for the album and actively participated as part of the team in making all the songs.[26][27][28][29] In 2005 Motnik made, in collaboration with drummer Gregg Bissonette, a solo CD Bass Invader. The album is an intense collection of 14 instrumental tracks. Most of the songs are originals, composed by Motnik, but there are also some cover songs. The bass patterns of the songs run the gauntlet of tonal possibilities and vary from soft ballads and acoustic sections to fast bass-played bits that sound like a regular guitar, even though they aren't. The main part of the album is the bass tunes played by Motnik, in addition to them, Swedish Mattias Eklundh plays the guitar in two songs.[23][30][31] In the autumn of 2021, Motnik released his second solo album, Dream Chaser. The album has ten instrumental songs, whose style varies from melodic rock to Latin American music, R&B, fusion, classical music, swing, jazz, and blues. Each song features a guest musician who plays his own solo. Guests on the album include guitarists Joe Satriani, Wolf Hoffmann, Bruce Kulick, Frank Gambale, Andy Timmons, Mattias Eklundh and Jennifer Batten, keyboardist Derek Sherinian and drummers Christopher Williams, Walfredo Reyes Jr., Joe Babiak, and Gregg Bissonette.[32][33][24][34] Motnik uses different playing techniques like tapping, slapping, plucking, picking, and impressive use of harmonics. He seems to know where the bass is traditionally supposed to be when combined with guitar and drums. He usually picks and strikes the strings with his fingers without a plectrum. After joining Accept, in concerts, he switched to using a plectrum and hangs the bass lower than before.[30][18] Since 2004, Motnik has been using a five-string Jens Ritter Roya bass guitar. After moving to Nashville, he did expand his arsenal with a couple of Fender Precisions. He uses Sadowsky bass guitars in Accept's concerts. In concerts, he often uses Line 6's effect pedals and the M9 pedal with a compressor setting. Another pedal he uses is a Gallien-Krueger Plex pedal.[35][24]",

        "text": "The 1897\u201398 season was Burslem Port Vale's second season of football (fourth overall) in the Midland League.[1] Under secretary\u2011manager Sam Gleaves and chairman Edward Oliver, Vale recovered from poor early form, losing seven of their opening nine, and went on a strong run between November and March to finish fifth with 23 points from 22 matches (10 wins, 3 draws, 9 losses), scoring 46 goals and conceding 32. In cup competitions, Vale enjoyed a memorable FA Cup run: they upset Football League First Division champions Sheffield United, defeating them in a replay to reach the Second Round, before bowing out to Burnley. They took West Bromwich Albion to a second replay in the Birmingham Senior Cup (exiting in the First Round) and advanced to the Staffordshire Senior Cup final, beating Stoke in the semi-finals but losing to West Brom in the final. For the second consecutive season, forwards Danny Simpson and Dick Evans shared the top scorer accolade with 11 goals in all competitions, Simpson netting nine in the Midland League. Vale drew a season-high 15,000 spectators for a cup tie against Sheffield United on 2 February 1898, while attendances averaged around 1,400, with lows of nearly 500. Their results, both in league and cup, helped earn re\u2011election to the Football League Second Division for the 1898\u201399 season. Burslem Port Vale retained the entire first-team of the 1896\u201397 campaign and strengthened the squad by signing four Stoke players: former England international right-back Tommy Clare, right-half Lucien Boullemier, left-winger Billy Heames and left-half Ted McDonald.[1] They unveiled a new kit of red and white striped tops with blue knickers.[1] The season opened with an \"exciting\" 2\u20132 draw with Burton Wanderers; the attendance at the Athletic Ground was a healthy 2,000, though Clare had trouble with his boots and played most of the match wearing just one of them.[1] Two away defeats followed, and young reserve Frank Mitchell was then installed at centre-forward and proved an instant success, scoring a hat-trick in a 4\u20130 home win over Kettering.[1] However, four league defeats later the players and directors met to discuss what was going wrong; the 1\u20130 defeat by Barnsley St Peter's was a particular calamity as goalkeeper Tom Poole  punched the ball into his own net from an indirect free kick.[1] Four league defeats were followed by four straight league wins, including a double over third-placed Rushden.[1] They then slipped to a 4\u20131 boxing day defeat at Kettering but recovered to beat Doncaster Rovers 4\u20130 to head into second-place on 3 January.[1] This started a run of five wins and two draws from seven games, with Clare being credited for inspiring the players \"with a confidence never before approached\".[1] However, they finished the campaign with two away defeats, ending up in fifth-place with 23 points from 22 games.[1] Danny Simpson finished with a tally of nine league goals, indicating that the club could benefit from a consistent goalscorer at centre-forward.[1] Nevertheless, the club's exploits in the FA Cup saw them achieve 18 votes in their successful application to rejoin the Football League.[1] The 1897\u201398 season saw the club lose \u00a3106, with the gate receipts from the FA Cup second round match raising \u00a360 more than the entire league campaign.[2] Vale found great success in the FA Cup, beating Football League Second Division side Small Heath 2\u20131 in the third qualification round thanks to a brace from Clare; Small Heath had originally proposed to switch the venue to Muntz Street for a \u00a3100 payment, but were refused.[1] The final scoreline was \"could scarcely be credited in Birmingham until the evening papers confirmed it\".[3] After a walkover victory against Kidderminster, they were fired by a \"special inducement\" and played \"with dash and skill\" to eliminate Burton Wanderers 2\u20131 to reach the first round proper.[1] Eventual Football League First Division champions Sheffield United were expecting to romp to victory at Bramall Lane, but the Vale team were in confident mood and held out for a 1\u20131 draw, the home side only staying in the tie due to a dubious penalty.[1] Vale rejected an offer of \u00a3250 to play the replay at Bramall Lane, and went on to win the tie 2\u20131; Dick Evans gave Vale a two-minute lead before United equalised with a rush goal eight minutes from time.[1] In extra time, United goalkeeper William Foulke \"acted in an idiotic manner\" and was caught out of position as Vale's Billy Heames broke away, running half the length of the pitch before pulling the ball back for Lucien Boullemier to score the winning goal.[1][4] Vale claimed earnings of \u00a3350 for the fixture as a crowd of 15,000 witnessed the giantkilling; the Burslem school board gave schoolchildren a special holiday so they could attend the game.[1] Second Division leaders Burnley awaited in the second round, but Vale were below par as they slipped to a 3\u20130 defeat at Turf Moor.[1][5] Vale were pitted against high-flying First Division club West Bromwich Albion in the first round of the Birmingham Senior Cup and, after two 0\u20130 draws, were finally beaten 2\u20131 in the second replay.[1] Vale confidently dispatched Burton Wanderers 5\u20130 in the first round of the Staffordshire Senior Cup.[1] A 3\u20131 win over Potteries derby rivals Stoke in front of a home crowd of 7,000 took them into the final for the first time, where they again faced West Bromwich Albion, this time at the neutral venue of the Victoria Ground.[1] A 8,500 crowd turned up, but West Brom denied Vale any silverware as they claimed a 2\u20131 victory.[1]",

        "text": "Pen-y-crug is a hill in the Brecon Beacons National Park in the county of Powys, south Wales. It is commonly referred to locally as simply 'The Crug' (pronounced cree-g).[citation needed] The Welsh name signifies 'top of the mound'. It slopes are moderately gently on three sides; only to the west do they steepen somewhat. Its flat trig point adorned summit at 331m overlooks the valley of the River Usk to the south. To the southeast are panoramic views over Brecon whilst eastwards are the Black Mountains and south the Brecon Beacons.[1] The hill is formed from sandstones and mudstones of the St. Maughans Formation of the Old Red Sandstone laid down during the Devonian period.  The lower slopes are formed from mudstones and sandstones of the Raglan Mudstone Formation of late Silurian age. A number of small sandstone quarries, now disused, adorn the upper slopes. The hill probably stood out above the Usk Valley glacier ice at times during the ice age.[2] A bridleway runs northwestwards over the northern and eastern slopes of the hill from the B4520 road on the northern edge of Brecon giving access to walkers, horseriders and mountain-bikers.

                "text": "Pen-y-crug is a hill in the Brecon Beacons National Park in the county of Powys, south Wales. It is commonly referred to locally as simply 'The Crug' (pronounced cree-g).[citation needed] The Welsh name signifies 'top of the mound'. It slopes are moderately gently on three sides; only to the west do they steepen somewhat. Its flat trig point adorned summit at 331m overlooks the valley of the River Usk to the south. To the southeast are panoramic views over Brecon whilst eastwards are the Black Mountains and south the Brecon Beacons.[1] The hill is formed from sandstones and mudstones of the St. Maughans Formation of the Old Red Sandstone laid down during the Devonian period. The lower slopes are formed from mudstones and sandstones of the Raglan Mudstone Formation of late Silurian age. A number of small sandstone quarries, now disused, adorn the upper slopes. The hill probably stood out above the Usk Valley glacier ice at times during the ice age.[2] A bridleway runs northwestwards over the northern and eastern slopes of the hill from the B4520 road on the northern edge of Brecon giving access to walkers, horseriders and mountain-bikers. A public footpath also leads to the summit from the edge of Brecon via Maen-du Well. The upper slopes are open access for walkers.

        "text": "Robert John Lagomarsino (September 4, 1926 \u2013 February 7, 2021) was an American politician and lawyer from California who served in the United States House of Representatives. A Republican, he began his service in the United States House of Representatives in 1974 and was re-elected every two years until 1992, when he was defeated for renomination by Michael Huffington. Before serving in the House, Lagomarsino served in the California State Senate from 1961 until 1974, and before that, he served as the mayor of Ojai, California.[1] Born and raised in Ventura, California, Lagomarsino was the son of Emilio Lagomarsino and Marjorie (Gates) Lagomarsino.[2] He attended the schools of Ventura and was a 1944 graduate of Ventura High School.[3][4] He served as a pharmacist mate in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946 and was a veteran of World War II.[3][5] He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1950 from the University of California, Santa Barbara and in 1953 he received a J.D. from the Santa Clara University School of Law.[6][7] He was admitted to the bar in 1954 and practiced law in Ventura.[8] In April 1958, Lagomarsino was elected to the Ojai City Council.[9] In December 1958, his council peers chose him to serve as mayor.[10] He held this office until resigning in late 1961 to enter the California Senate.[11][12] In the California Senate, Lagomarsino's most significant legislative achievements included the Garrigus-Lagomarsino Act (1963),[13] which authorized vocational education centers in each county of the State; the California Child Anti-Pornography Act (1969); the Marine Resources Protection Act (1970); the California Wild and Scenic Rivers legislation; the Jury Reform Act (1972); the Consumer Protection Act (1972), which authorized cities to create anti-fraud units; and the Welfare Reform Act (1973). By the time he was elected to the United States Congress, the senior ranking senator from Southern California and a member of the five-person Senate Rules Committee, after having served as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Wildlife.[14] In 1974, Congressman Charles Teague, of what was then California's 13th congressional district, where Lagomarsino resided, died suddenly. Lagomarsino was elected to replace Teague as the 13th district congressman in a special election in 1974. He was the only Republican in a 1974 special election to hold a district for his party.[15] During his service as a United States Congressman, Lagomarsino was an active member of two major House Committees: the Foreign Affairs Committee, as the third-ranking Republican and the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, as the second-ranking Republican. He was a Congressional Observer to the Geneva Arms Controls Talks and Vice Chairman of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, which oversaw U.S. relations with Canada, Central America, and South America. He was also Chairman of the National Republican Institute for International Affairs, Co-Chairman of the Congressional Task Force on Afghanistan, and a member of the Asian and Pacific Affairs Committee. In addition, Lagomarsino served as Chairman of the POW/MIA Task Force and was the House author of a measure creating the Prisoner of War Medal. Lagomarsino made several trips abroad as a congressman. He toured South America, the Far East, the Pacific Region, the Soviet Union, and Europe numerous times, but held a particular interest in Southeast Asia; meeting with the Laos government in 1989 and, later, the Vietnamese government in 1990, to obtain information on American POW/MIA's in Southeast Asia. He toured the Panama Canal as part of President Carter\u2019s diplomacy and observed Panama's national elections and Kuwait invasion under President Bush. Lagomarsino also attended annual interparliamentary conferences in Mexico and on the European continent. During his service in Washington, Lagomarsino specialized in environmental concerns, foreign affairs (particularly Latin America), and illegal drug trafficking. He authored legislation that created the Channel Islands National Park, the Dick Smith Wilderness Area, the Los Padres National Forest, and co-authored the Drug War Bond Act and the Violent Crime and Drug Control Act. He was a leader in efforts to open overseas markets to U.S. products and to ban the transfer of strategic goods or technology. Lagomarsino maintained a voting record of 99% and took pride in voting against all proposed congressional pay raises. Before the 1992 congressional elections, a congressional reapportionment plan placed Lagomarsino's residence within the congressional district of fellow Republican Elton Gallegly. Rather than run against Gallegly, Lagomarsino moved to the 22nd District, part of which he already represented, and ran for re-election there. He was challenged in the Republican primary by millionaire Michael Huffington, who defeated Lagomarsino by nearly seven percentage points.[16] Lagomarsino was a long-time advocate of establishing a state college in his native Ventura County. His goal came to fruition in 2002, with the establishment of the California State University Channel Islands (CSUCI). A collection of papers, memorabilia, and furniture Lagomarsino had previously donated to the Ventura satellite campus of the California State University, Northridge was transitioned to CSUCI. In 2002, the university's library formally established the Robert J. and Norma M. Lagomarsino Department of Archives and Special Collections.[17] Lagomarsino continued to be active, serving on numerous community boards in and around Santa Barbara County and Ventura County, and on the Board of the California Center for Public Policy.[18] He and his wife Norma (d. 2015) lived in Ventura, California, and they had three children and six grandchildren.[19] Lagomarsino died on February 7, 2021, at his family ranch in Ojai, California.[20] The visitor center at Channel Islands National Park is named after Lagomarsino.[21]",

McLain was born in Jonesville, Louisiana, on March 15, 1940.[1] He first began performing in the 1950s, along with country singer Clint West. The two were both members of The Vel-Tones in the late 1950s and the Boogie Kings in the 1960s, and they recorded a duet, \"Try to Find Another Man\", in 1965. He also performed on Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars in the 1960s and DJed at Louisiana radio station, KREH. McLain's greatest fame was with his recording of the song \"Sweet Dreams\", which hit No. 15 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in 1966.[2] In Canada it was No. 7.[3] It reached No. 49 in the UK Singles Chart the same year.[4] He also wrote Freddy Fender's hit single, \"If You Don't Love Me Alone (Leave Me Alone)\". McLain appears along with the Mule Train Band in the film The Drowning Pool. McLain used to perform in the American Deep South with his backing group, the Mule Train Band. In October 2007, McLain was inducted into the Louisiana Music Hall of Fame.[5] McLain was more recently featured as a guest artist on an album recorded by Larry Lange and his Lonely Knights of Austin, Texas, entitled Wiggle Room[6] (2011), which debuted two brand new songs penned by McLain; perhaps the most notable one being, \"Don't Make Me Leave New Orleans\", a heart-felt ballad that McLain wrote in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.[citation needed] British singer Lily Allen included McLain's cover of Fats Domino's song \"Before I Grow Too Old\" as one of her eight favorite songs on the British radio programme Desert Island Discs, on 29 June 2014.[citation needed] On August 26, 2022, McLain released his first album in over 40 years, entitled I Ran Down Every Dream.[7] This collaboration included 11 songs written by McLain and credits with numerous others including Elvis Costello, Nick Lowe (both of whom contribute co-writes), plus Jon Cleary, Denny Freeman, Ed Harcourt, Roy Lowe, Augie Meyers, Ivan Neville, Van Dyke Parks, Mickey Raphael, Steve Riley, Speedy Sparks, Warren Storm and others.[8] McLain died in Hessmer, Louisiana on July 24, 2025, at the age of 85.[1][9]",

Wainwright made the song available for purchase after a premiere performance on The Late Late Show with James Corden on October 18, with a portion of proceeds benefiting voter registration efforts. The song's music video, directed by Andrew Ondrejcak, features Wainwright as Dionysius II of Syracuse and Darren Criss as Damocles. \"Sword of Damocles\", written by Wainwright around the United States presidential election in 2016, alludes to the story of Damocles and the perils faced by those in positions of power.[1] Wainwright developed the song after hearing his friend Carrie Fisher use the anecdote \"the Sword of Damocles\" in conversation to describe her \"troubled state of mind\".[1][2] The singer recalled, \"I had no idea what [Carrie] was referring to, but it rang into one ear and didn't leave the other one. It was just stuck in my head. And it became this uneasy thread that I started writing about. It wasn't even about politics at the time, more about this gnawing feeling that something was occurring.\"[1] Following the 2016 election, Wainwright researched the story of Damocles and finished writing the song. He recorded \"Sword of Damocles\" in 2017,[1] and started performing the song at concerts.[2][3] Wainwright released the song in 2018, prior to the mid-term elections, to encourage people to vote.[1] He described the song as his \"artistic response to what [he sees] currently transpiring within the American government and how its collapse is affecting every aspect of existence for us all\".[4] Furthermore, Wainwright said in a statement: With the Midterm Elections around the corner, it\u2019s important for everyone to take a stand and contribute in some way \u2013 whether it\u2019s bringing awareness to issues in your community, protesting/demonstrating, watching the news to formulate your own opinions, creating, yelling \u2013 it\u2019s all hands on deck... The famed, ancient expression 'Sword of Damocles' is a parable of impending doom of and to those in positions of power. This timeless tale points out the hard fact that with great power, comes great responsibility, and for all concerned, great danger. VOTE.[5] The song's lyrics, which are critical of President Donald Trump,[4] were described as \"doomy\" by Brooke Bajgrowicz of Billboard.[5] The music magazine's Nicole Engelman called \"Sword of Damocles\" as a \"swelling\" piano ballad \"[dripping] in political satire.\"[6] Rolling Stone's Ryan Reed described the song as a ballad in which Wainwright \"croons over stately piano chords\".[4] Colin Bertram of Bloomberg.com called the song a \"political anthem\".[1] Wainwright debuted the song on The Late Late Show with James Corden on October 18, 2018.[5][7] He was accompanied by a pianist and illuminated by purple lights. According to Bajgrowicz, Wainwright's performance \"instantly captivat[ed] the audience\".[5] The studio version of \"Sword of Damocles\" was first made available on Bandcamp, with some proceeds benefitting voter registration efforts via the progressive political group Swing Left.[1][5] The song's music video, released on October 30, was directed by Andrew Ondrejcak and features Wainwright as Dionysius II of Syracuse and Darren Criss portraying Damocles.[1] Trump is not referenced directly, but the introduction displays the text: \"Dear Mr. President, This ancient story, from the 4th century, reminds me of you. Love, Rufus\".[1] Then, text describes the story of Damocles: At a lavish banquet, King Dionysius is confronted by his servant Damocles \u2013 a brat who is jealous of the king's splendor and power. Through supernatural forces, the two roles are switched. The smug, inexperienced commoner becomes the king. But his joy is short-lived. He quickly realizes that being king isn't all crowns and cheeseburgers. With great power comes great responsibility.[4] The two men sit at opposite ends of a table, and Dionysius is showered with fortunes before he shares them with Damocles.[1] The background visuals become increasingly \"absurd\" as the fortunes are transferred; among the colorful effects are golden orbs and a maggot-infested hamburger. Damocles is shown with a sword hovering above his head,[4] and the video ends with the text \"Vote.\"[6] Wainwright and Criss wore costumes designed by Vivienne Westwood.[1] Reed described the music video as \"experimental\".[4] Wainwright said of its simplicity, \"I think if I had gone out being really overwrought politically, it doesn't hit the mark. You're speaking to the converted at this point. America is so divided now that any message shot across the bow has to be put within a larger context... In the end we are all the king, and we all have this sword above our heads that is about to fall.\"[1] American Songwriter's Brianna Goebel called the song \"heartfelt\" and the music video \"compelling\".[8] Reed described \"Sword of Damocles\" as \"artful\" and \"ornate\".[4]",

Damocles is shown with a sword hovering above his head,[4] and the video ends with the text \"Vote.\"[6] Wainwright and Criss wore costumes designed by Vivienne Westwood.[1] Reed described the music video as \"experimental\".[4] Wainwright said of its simplicity, \"I think if I had gone out being really overwrought politically, it doesn't hit the mark. You're speaking to the converted at this point. America is so divided now that any message shot across the bow has to be put within a larger context... In the end we are all the king, and we all have this sword above our heads that is about to fall.\"[1] American Songwriter's Brianna Goebel called the song \"heartfelt\" and the music video \"compelling\".[8] Reed described \"Sword of Damocles\" as \"artful\" and \"ornate\".[4]"

HPGD RNA-seq was performed in tissue samples from 95 human individuals representing 27 different tissues to determine tissue-specificity of all protein-coding genes.[17] HPGD was expressed in the adrenal, appendix, bone marrow, brain, colon, duodenum, endometrium, esophagus, fat, gall bladder, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, ovary, pancreas, placenta, prostate, salivary gland, skin, small intestine, spleen, stomach, testis, thyroid, urinary bladder [1] 15-HPGD has an unappreciated role in the maintenance of pregnancy. In mice, 15-HPDG has been shown to have essential roles in prevention of early termination of pregnancy and maternal morbidity.[18] In 15-HPGD knockout mice, early pregnancy termination was detected. 15-HPGD KO mice that were able to establish pregnancy, lost pregnancy by gestation day ~8.5. At time of pregnancy loss, 15-HPGD KO mice have normal levels of PGE2, increased levels of PGF2\u03b1 and decreasing levels of serum progesterone.[18] A hypomorphic mutation of 15-HPGD causes mice to enter labor ~ a full day earlier when compared to their wild-type littermates, due to elevated circulating PGF2\u03b1 concentrations. Furthermore, it was concluded that 15-HPGD has a critical role in determining the timing of labor[19]",

        "text": "A funeral is a ceremony connected with the final disposition of a corpse, such as a burial, entombment or cremation with the attendant observances.[1] Funerary customs comprise the complex of beliefs and practices used by a culture to remember and respect the dead, from interment, to various monuments, prayers, and rituals undertaken in their honour. Customs vary between cultures and religious groups.  Funerals have both normative and legal components. Common secular motivations for funerals include mourning the deceased, celebrating their life, and offering support and sympathy to the bereaved; additionally, funerals may have religious aspects that are intended to help the soul of the deceased reach the afterlife, resurrection or reincarnation. The funeral usually includes a ritual through which the corpse receives a final disposition.[2] Depending on culture and religion, these can involve either the destruction of the body (for example, by cremation, sky burial, decomposition, disintegration or dissolution) or its preservation (for example, by mummification). Differing beliefs about cleanliness and the relationship between body and soul are reflected in funerary practices. A memorial service (service of remembrance or celebration of life) is a funerary ceremony that is performed without the remains of the deceased person.[3] In both a closed casket funeral[4] and a memorial service, photos of the deceased representing stages of life would be displayed on an altar. Relatives or friends would give out eulogies in both services as well.[5] The word funeral comes from the Latin funus, which had a variety of meanings, including the corpse and the funerary rites themselves. Funerary art is art produced in connection with burials, including many kinds of tombs, and objects specially made for burial like flowers with a corpse. Funeral rites pre-date modern Homo sapiens and dated to at least 300,000 years ago.[6] For example, in the Shanidar Cave in Iraq, in Pontnewydd Cave in Wales and at other sites across Europe and the Near East,[6] Archaeologists have discovered Neanderthal skeletons with a characteristic layer of flower pollen. This deliberate burial and reverence given to the dead has been interpreted as suggesting that Neanderthals had religious beliefs,[6] although the evidence is not unequivocal \u2013 while the dead were apparently buried deliberately, burrowing rodents could have introduced the flowers.[7] Substantial cross-cultural and historical research document funeral customs as a highly predictable, stable force in communities.[8][9] Funeral customs tend to be characterized by five \"anchors\": significant symbols, gathered community, ritual action, cultural heritage, and transition of the dead body (corpse).[2] The most common venues for funeral services would be in a place of worship (synagogue or church) or a funeral home. However, a cemetery's chapel features a reflecting serene intimacy as well as a respectful environment for clergy, mourning families and friends. Graveside services are a less common option for these rituals. A mausoleum's chapel mostly intends to be for entombment after the funeral itself. These two funerary chapels both generously accommodate open or closed-casket services prior to a traditional burial within the cemetery. If a funeral is subsequently followed by cremation, the service would be in a crematorium. In the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, burial law prescribes both the location of burial and burial practices and precludes cremation of the dead. It is forbidden to carry the body for more than one hour's journey from the place of death. Before interment the body should be wrapped in a shroud of silk or cotton, and a ring should be placed on its finger bearing the inscription \"I came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate\". The coffin should be of crystal, stone or hard fine wood. Also, before interment, a specific Prayer for the Dead[10] is ordained. The body should be placed with the feet facing the Qiblih. The formal prayer and the ring are meant to be used for those who have reached 15 years of age. Since there are no Bah\u00e1'\u00ed clergy, services are usually conducted under the guidance, or with the assistance of, a Local Spiritual Assembly.[11][12][13] A Buddhist funeral marks the transition from one life to the next for the deceased. It also reminds the living of their own mortality. Cremation is the preferred choice,[14] although burial is also allowed. Buddhists in Tibet perform sky burials where the body is exposed to be eaten by vultures. The body is dissected with a blade on the mountain top before the exposure. Crying and wailing is discouraged and the rogyapas (body breakers who perform the ritual) laugh as if they are doing farm work. Tibetan Buddhists believe that a lighthearted atmosphere during the funeral helps the soul of the dead to get a better afterlife. After the vultures consume all the flesh the rogpyas smash the bones into pieces and mix them with tsampa to feed to the vultures.[15] Congregations of varied denominations perform different funeral ceremonies, but most involve offering prayers, scripture reading from the Bible, a sermon, homily, or eulogy, and music.[2][16] One issue of concern as the 21st century began was with the use of secular music at Christian funerals, a custom generally forbidden by the Catholic Church.[17] Christian burials have traditionally occurred on consecrated ground such as in churchyards. There are many funeral norms in Christianity.[18] Burial, rather than a destructive process such as cremation, was the traditional practice amongst Christians, because of the belief in the resurrection of the body. Cremations later came into widespread use, although some denominations forbid them. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops said \"The Church earnestly recommends that the pious custom of burying the bodies of the deceased be observed; nevertheless, the Church does not prohibit cremation unless it was chosen for reasons contrary to Christian doctrine\" (canon 1176.3).[19][20] Antyesti, literally 'last rites' or 'last sacrifice', refers to the rite-of-passage rituals associated with a funeral in Hinduism.[21] It is sometimes referred to as Antima Samskaram, Antya-kriya, Anvarohanyya, or Vahni Sanskara. A dead adult Hindu is cremated, while a dead child is typically buried.[22][23] The rite of passage is said to be performed in harmony with the sacred premise that the microcosm of all living beings is a reflection of a macrocosm of the universe.[24] The soul (Atman, Brahman) is believed to be the immortal essence that is released at the Antyeshti ritual, but both the body and the universe are vehicles and transitory in various schools of Hinduism. They consist of five elements: air, water, fire, earth and space.[24] The last rite of passage returns the body to the five elements and origins.[22][24] The roots of this belief are found in the Vedas, for example in the hymns of Rigveda in section 10.16, as follows: Burn him not up, nor quite consume him, Agni: let not his body or his skin be scattered,\nO all possessing Fire, when thou hast matured him, then send him on his way unto the Fathers.\nWhen thou hast made him ready, all possessing Fire, then do thou give him over to the Fathers,\nWhen he attains unto the life that waits him, he shall become subject to the will of gods.\nThe Sun receive thine eye, the Wind thy Prana (life-principle, breathe); go, as thy merit is, to earth or heaven.\nGo, if it be thy lot, unto the waters; go, make thine home in plants with all thy members. \u2014\u200aRigveda 10.16[25] The final rites of a burial, in case of untimely death of a child, is rooted in Rigveda's section 10.18, where the hymns mourn the death of the child, praying to deity Mrityu to \"neither harm our girls nor our boys\", and pleads the earth to cover, protect the deceased child as a soft wool.[26][27] Among Hindus, the dead body is usually cremated within a day of death. In Hindu tradition, the body is usually kept at home with the family until its time for cremation. A typical Hindu funeral includes three main stages: a gathering or wake in the home, the cremation itself\u2014referred to as mukhagni\u2014and a follow-up ritual called the shraddha ceremony.[28] The body is washed, wrapped in white cloth for a man or a widow, red for a married woman,[23] the two toes tied together with a string, a Tilak (red mark) placed on the forehead.[22] The dead adult's body is carried to the cremation ground near a river or water, by family and friends, and placed on a pyre with feet facing south.[23] The eldest son, or a male mourner, or a priest then bathes before leading the cremation ceremonial function.[22][29] He circumambulates the dry wood pyre with the body, says a eulogy or recites a hymn in some cases, places sesame seed in the dead person's mouth, sprinkles the body and the pyre with ghee (clarified butter), then draws three lines signifying Yama (deity of the dead), Kala (time, deity of cremation) and the dead.[22] The pyre is then set ablaze, while the mourners mourn. The ash from the cremation is consecrated to the nearest river or sea.[29] After the cremation, a period of mourning is observed for 10 to 12 days after which the immediate male relatives or the sons of the deceased shave their head, trim their nails, recites prayers with the help of priest or Brahmin and invite all relatives, kins, friends and neighbours to eat a simple meal together in remembrance of the deceased.\nDuring the mourning period, sleeping arrangements in the home change too. Mattresses are taken off the beds and placed on the floor, and for twelve days, everyone in the household sleeps on the floor as part of the funeral customs.[30] This day, in some communities, also marks a day when the poor and needy are offered food in memory of the dead.[31] In most Hindu communities the last day of the mourning is called as Terahveen (the thirteenth day), and on this day items of basic needs along with some favourite items of the deceased are donated to the priests. Also on the same day the eldest son of the family is ceremonially crowned (called Pagdi Rasm) for he is now the head of the family. A feast is also organised for Brahmins, family members, and friends.[32] The belief that bodies are infested by Nasu upon death greatly influenced Zoroastrian burial ceremonies and funeral rites. Burial and cremation of corpses was prohibited, as such acts would defile the sacred creations of earth and fire respectively.[33] Burial of corpses was so looked down upon that the exhumation of \"buried corpses was regarded as meritorious.\" For these reasons, \"Towers of Silence\" were developed\u2014open air, amphitheater like structures in which corpses were placed so carrion-eating birds could feed on them. Sagd\u012bd, meaning 'seen by a dog,' is a ritual that must be performed as promptly after death as possible. The dog is able to calculate the degree of evil within the corpse, and entraps the contamination so it may not spread further, expelling Nasu from the body.[34] Nasu remains within the corpse until it has been seen by a dog, or until it has been consumed by a dog or a carrion-eating bird.[35] According to chapter 31 of the Denkard, the reasoning for the required consumption of corpses is that the evil influences of Nasu are contained within the corpse until, upon being digested, the body is changed from the form of nasa into nourishment for animals. The corpse is thereby delivered over to the animals, changing from the state of corrupted nasa to that of hixr, which is \"dry dead matter,\" considered to be less polluting. A path through which a funeral procession has traveled must not be passed again, as Nasu haunts the area thereafter, until the proper rites of banishment are performed.[36] Nasu is expelled from the area only after \"a yellow dog with four eyes, or a white dog with yellow ears\" is walked through the path three times.[37] If the dog goes unwillingly down the path, it must be walked back and forth up to nine times to ensure that Nasu has been driven off.[38] Zoroastrian ritual exposure of the dead is first known of from the writings of the mid-5th century BCE Herodotus, who observed the custom amongst Iranian expatriates in Asia Minor. In Herodotus' account (Histories i.140), the rites are said to have been \"secret\", but were first performed after the body had been dragged around by a bird or dog. The corpse was then embalmed with wax and laid in a trench. While the discovery of ossuaries in both eastern and western Iran dating to the 5th and 4th centuries BCE indicates that bones were isolated, that this separation occurred through ritual exposure cannot be assumed: burial mounds,[39] where the bodies were wrapped in wax, have also been discovered. The tombs of the Achaemenid emperors at Naqsh-e Rustam and Pasargadae likewise suggest non-exposure, at least until the bones could be collected. According to legend (incorporated by Ferdowsi into his Shahnameh), Zoroaster is himself interred in a tomb at Balkh (in present-day Afghanistan). Writing on the culture of the Persians, Herodotus reports on the Persian burial customs performed by the Magi, which are kept secret. However, he writes that he knows they expose the body of male dead to dogs and birds of prey, then they cover the corpse in wax, and then it is buried.[40] The Achaemenid custom is recorded for the dead in the regions of Bactria, Sogdia, and Hyrcania, but not in Western Iran. The Byzantine historian Agathias has described the burial of the Sasanian general Mihr-Mihroe: \"the attendants of Mermeroes took up his body and removed it to a place outside the city and laid it there as it was, alone and uncovered according to their traditional custom, as refuse for dogs and horrible carrion\". Towers are a much later invention and are first documented in the early 9th century CE. The ritual customs surrounding that practice appear to date to the Sassanid era (3rd\u20137th century CE). They are known in detail from the supplement to the Sh\u0101yest n\u0113 Sh\u0101yest, the two Revayats collections, and the two Saddars. Funerals in Islam (called Janazah in Arabic) follow fairly specific rites. In all cases, however, sharia (Islamic religious law) calls for burial of the body, preceded by a simple ritual involving bathing and shrouding the body, followed by salat (prayer). Burial rituals should normally take place as soon as possible and include: The mourning period is 40 days long.[44] In Judaism, funerals follow fairly specific rites, though they are subject to variation in custom. Halakha calls for preparatory rituals involving bathing and shrouding the body accompanied by prayers and readings from the Hebrew Bible, and then a funeral service marked by eulogies and brief prayers, and then the lowering of the body into the grave and the filling of the grave. Traditional law and practice forbid cremation of the body; the Reform Jewish movement generally discourages cremation but does not outright forbid it.[45][46] Burial rites should normally take place as soon as possible and include: In Sikhism death is considered a natural process, an event that has absolute certainty and only happens as a direct result of God's Will or Hukam.[48] In Sikhism, birth and death are closely associated, as they are part of the cycle of human life of \"coming and going\" (Punjabi: \u0a06\u0a35\u0a23\u0a41 \u0a1c\u0a3e\u0a23\u0a3e, romanized:\u00a0Aana Jaana) which is seen as a transient stage towards Liberation (\u0a2e\u0a4b\u0a16\u0a41 \u0a26\u0a41\u0a06\u0a30\u0a41, Mokh Du-aar), understood as completely in unity with God. Sikhs believe in reincarnation. Death is only the progression of the soul on its journey from God, through the created universe and back to God again. In life a Sikh is expected to constantly remember death so that they may be sufficiently prayerful, detached and righteous to break the cycle of birth and death and return to God. The public display of grief by wailing or crying out loud at the funeral (called Antam Sanskar) is discouraged and should be kept to a minimum. Cremation is the preferred method of disposal, burial and burial at sea are also allowed if by necessity or by the will of the person. Markers such as gravestones, monuments, etc. are not allowed, because the body is considered to be just the shell and the person's soul is their real self.[49] On the day of the cremation, the body is washed and dressed and then taken to the Gurdwara or home where hymns (Shabadads) from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, the Sikh Scriptures are recited by the congregation. Kirtan may also be performed by Ragis while the relatives of the deceased recite \"Waheguru\" sitting near the coffin. This service normally takes from 30 to 60 minutes. At the conclusion of the service, an Ardas is said before the coffin is taken to the cremation site. At the point of cremation, a few more Shabadads may be sung and final speeches are made about the deceased person. The eldest son or a close relative generally lights the fire. This service usually lasts about 30 to 60 minutes. The ashes are later collected and disposed of by immersing them in a river, preferably one of the five rivers in the state of Punjab, India. The ceremony in which the Sidharan Paath is begun after the cremation ceremony, may be held when convenient, wherever the Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji is present. Hymns are sung from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji; the first five and final verses of \"Anand Sahib,\" the \"Song of Bliss,\" are recited or sung. The first five verses of Sikhism's morning prayer, \"Japji Sahib\", are read aloud to begin the Sidharan paath. A hukam, or random verse, is then read from Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji. Ardas, a prayer, is offered, and Prashad, a sacred sweet, is distributed. Langar, a meal, is then served to guests. While the Sidharan paath is being read, the family may also sing hymns daily. Reading may take as long as needed to complete the paath. This ceremony is followed by Sahaj Paath Bhog, Kirtan Sohila, night time prayer is recited for one week, and finally Ardas called the \"Antim Ardas\" (\"Final Prayer\") is offered the last week.[50] It was custom for an officiant to walk in front of the coffin with a horse's skull; this tradition was still observed by Welsh peasants up until the 19th century.[51] The Greek word for funeral \u2013 k\u0113de\u00eda (\u03ba\u03b7\u03b4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1) \u2013 derives from the verb k\u0113domai (\u03ba\u03ae\u03b4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9), that means attend to, take care of someone. Derivative words are also k\u0113dem\u00f3n (\u03ba\u03b7\u03b4\u03b5\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd, \"guardian\") and k\u0113demon\u00eda (\u03ba\u03b7\u03b4\u03b5\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03af\u03b1, \"guardianship\"). From the Cycladic civilization in 3000 BCE until the Hypo-Mycenaean era in 1200\u20131100 BCE the main practice of burial is interment. The cremation of the dead that appears around the 11th century BCE constitutes a new practice of burial and is probably an influence from the East. Until the Christian era, when interment becomes again the only burial practice, both cremation and interment had been practiced depending on the area.[52] The ancient Greek funeral since the Homeric era included the pr\u00f3thesis (\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2), the ekphor\u00e1 (\u1f10\u03ba\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac), the burial and the per\u00eddeipnon (\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd). In most cases, this process is followed faithfully in Greece until today.[53] Pr\u00f3thesis is the deposition of the body of the deceased on the funeral bed and the threnody of his relatives. Today the body is placed in the casket, that is always open in Greek funerals. This part takes place in the house where the deceased had lived. An important part of the Greek tradition is the epicedium, the mournful songs that are sung by the family of the deceased along with professional mourners (who are extinct in the modern era). The deceased was watched over by his beloved the entire night before the burial, an obligatory ritual in popular thought, which is maintained still. Ekphor\u00e1 is the process of transport of the mortal remains of the deceased from his residence to the church, nowadays, and afterward to the place of burial. The procession in the ancient times, according to the law, should have passed silently through the streets of the city. Usually certain favourite objects of the deceased were placed in the coffin in order to \"go along with him\". In certain regions, coins to pay Charon, who ferries the dead to the underworld, are also placed inside the casket. A last kiss is given to the beloved dead by the family before the coffin is closed. The Roman orator Cicero[54] describes the habit of planting flowers around the tomb as an effort to guarantee the repose of the deceased and the purification of the ground, a custom that is maintained until today. After the ceremony, the mourners return to the house of the deceased for the per\u00eddeipnon, the dinner after the burial. According to archaeological findings \u2013 traces of ash, bones of animals, shards of crockery, dishes and basins \u2013 the dinner during the classical era was also organized at the burial spot. Taking into consideration the written sources, however, the dinner could also be served in the houses.[55] The Necrodeipnon (\u039d\u03b5\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd) was the funeral banquet which was given at the house of the nearest relative.[56][57] Two days after the burial, a ceremony called \"the thirds\" was held. Eight days after the burial the relatives and the friends of the deceased assembled at the burial spot, where \"the ninths\" would take place, a custom still kept. In addition to this, in the modern era, memorial services take place 40 days, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year after the death and from then on every year on the anniversary of the death. The relatives of the deceased, for an unspecified length of time that depends on them, are in mourning, during which women wear black clothes and men a black armband.[clarification needed] Nekysia (\u039d\u03b5\u03ba\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1), meaning the day of the dead, and Genesia (\u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1), meaning the day of the forefathers (ancestors), were yearly feasts in honour of the dead.[58][59] Nemesia (\u039d\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1) or Nemeseia (N\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) was also a yearly feast in honour of the dead, most probably intended for averting the anger of the dead.[60][61] In ancient Rome, the eldest surviving male of the household, the pater familias, was summoned to the death-bed, where he attempted to catch and inhale the last breath of the decedent. Funerals of the socially prominent usually were undertaken by professional undertakers called libitinarii. No direct description has been passed down of Roman funeral rites. These rites usually included a public procession to the tomb or pyre where the body was to be cremated. The surviving relations bore masks bearing the images of the family's deceased ancestors. The right to carry the masks in public eventually was restricted to families prominent enough to have held curule magistracies. Mimes, dancers, and musicians hired by the undertakers, and professional female mourners, took part in these processions. Less well-to-do Romans could join benevolent funerary societies (collegia funeraticia) that undertook these rites on their behalf. Nine days after the disposal of the body, by burial or cremation, a feast was given (cena novendialis) and a libation poured over the grave or the ashes. Since most Romans were cremated, the ashes typically were collected in an urn and placed in a niche in a collective tomb called a columbarium (literally, \"dovecote\").[62] During this nine-day period, the house was considered to be tainted, funesta, and was hung with Taxus baccata or Mediterranean Cypress branches to warn passersby. At the end of the period, the house was swept out to symbolically purge it of the taint of death. Several Roman holidays commemorated a family's dead ancestors, including the Parentalia, held February 13 through 21, to honor the family's ancestors; and the Feast of the Lemures, held on May 9, 11, and 13, in which ghosts (larvae) were feared to be active, and the pater familias sought to appease them with offerings of beans. The Romans prohibited cremation or inhumation within the sacred boundary of the city (pomerium), for both religious and civil reasons, so that the priests might not be contaminated by touching a dead body, and that houses would not be endangered by funeral fires. Restrictions on the length, ostentation, expense of, and behaviour during funerals and mourning gradually were enacted by a variety of lawmakers. Often the pomp and length of rites could be politically or socially motivated to advertise or aggrandise a particular kin group in Roman society. This was seen as deleterious to society and conditions for grieving were set. For instance, under some laws, women were prohibited from loud wailing or lacerating their faces and limits were introduced for expenditure on tombs and burial clothes. The Romans commonly built tombs for themselves during their lifetime. Hence these words frequently occur in ancient inscriptions, V.F. Vivus Facit, V.S.P. Vivus Sibi Posuit. The tombs of the rich usually were constructed of marble, the ground enclosed with walls, and planted around with trees. But common sepulchres usually were built below ground, and called hypogea. There were niches cut out of the walls, in which the urns were placed; these, from their resemblance to the niche of a pigeon-house, were called columbaria. Within the United States and Canada, in most cultural groups and regions, the funeral rituals can be divided into three parts: visitation, funeral, and the burial service. A home funeral (services prepared and conducted by the family, with little or no involvement from professionals) is legal in nearly every part of North America, but in the 21st century, they are uncommon in the US.[63] At the visitation (also called a \"viewing\", \"wake\" or \"calling hours\"), in Christian or secular Western custom, the body of the deceased person (or decedent) is placed on display in the casket (also called a coffin, however almost all body containers are caskets). The viewing often takes place on one or two evenings before the funeral. In the past, it was common practice to place the casket in the decedent's home or that of a relative for viewing. This practice continues in many areas of Ireland and Scotland. The body is traditionally dressed in the decedent's best clothes. In recent times there has been more variation in what the decedent is dressed in \u2013 some people choose to be dressed in clothing more reflective of how they dressed in life. The body will often be adorned with common jewelry, such as watches, necklaces, brooches, etc. The jewelry may be taken off and given to the family of the deceased prior to burial or be buried with the deceased. Jewelry has to be removed before cremation in order to prevent damage to the crematory. The body may or may not be embalmed, depending upon such factors as the amount of time since the death has occurred, religious practices, or requirements of the place of burial. The most commonly prescribed aspects of this gathering are that the attendees sign a book kept by the deceased's survivors to record who attended. In addition, a family may choose to display photographs taken of the deceased person during his/her life (often, formal portraits with other family members and candid pictures to show \"happy times\"), prized possessions and other items representing his/her hobbies and/or accomplishments. A more recent trend[when?] is to create a DVD with pictures and video of the deceased, accompanied by music, and play this DVD continuously during the visitation. The viewing is either \"open casket\", in which the embalmed body of the deceased has been clothed and treated with cosmetics for display; or \"closed casket\", in which the coffin is closed. The coffin may be closed if the body was too badly damaged because of an accident or fire or other trauma, deformed from illness, if someone in the group is emotionally unable to cope with viewing the corpse, or if the deceased did not wish to be viewed. In cases such as these, a picture of the deceased, usually a formal photo, is placed atop the casket. However, this step is foreign to Judaism; Jewish funerals are held soon after death (preferably within a day or two, unless more time is needed for relatives to come), and the corpse is never displayed. Torah law forbids embalming.[64] Traditionally flowers (and music) are not sent to a grieving Jewish family as it is a reminder of the life that is now lost. The Jewish shiva tradition discourages family members from cooking, so food is brought by friends and neighbors.[44] (See also Jewish bereavement.) The decedent's closest friends and relatives who are unable to attend frequently send flowers to the viewing, with the exception of a Jewish funeral,[65] where flowers would not be appropriate (donations are often given to a charity instead). Obituaries sometimes contain a request that attendees do not send flowers (e.g. \"In lieu of flowers\"). The use of these phrases has been on the rise for the past century. In the US in 1927, only 6% of the obituaries included the directive, with only 2% of those mentioned charitable contributions instead. By the middle of the century, they had grown to 15%, with over 54% of those noting a charitable contribution as the preferred method of expressing sympathy.[66] The deceased is usually transported from the funeral home to a church in a hearse, a specialized vehicle designed to carry casketed remains. The deceased is often transported in a procession (also called a funeral cort\u00e8ge), with the hearse, funeral service vehicles, and private automobiles traveling in a procession to the church or other location where the services will be held. In a number of jurisdictions, special laws cover funeral processions \u2013 such as requiring most other vehicles to give right-of-way to a funeral procession. Funeral service vehicles may be equipped with light bars and special flashers to increase their visibility on the roads. They may also all have their headlights on, to identify which vehicles are part of the cortege, although the practice also has roots in ancient Roman customs.[67] After the funeral service, if the deceased is to be buried the funeral procession will proceed to a cemetery if not already there. If the deceased is to be cremated, the funeral procession may then proceed to the crematorium. Funeral customs vary from country to country. In the United States, any type of noise other than quiet whispering or mourning is considered disrespectful. A burial tends to cost more than a cremation.[68] At a religious burial service, conducted at the side of the grave, tomb, mausoleum or cremation, the body of the decedent is buried or cremated at the conclusion. Sometimes, the burial service will immediately follow the funeral, in which case a funeral procession travels from the site of the funeral to the burial site. In some other cases, the burial service is the funeral, in which case the procession might travel from the cemetery office to the grave site. Other times, the burial service takes place at a later time, when the final resting place is ready, if the death occurred in the middle of winter. If the decedent served in a branch of the Armed forces, military rites are often accorded at the burial service.[69] In many religious traditions, pallbearers, usually males who are relatives or friends of the decedent, will carry the casket from the chapel (of a funeral home or church) to the hearse, and from the hearse to the site of the burial service.[70] Most religions expect coffins to be kept closed during the burial ceremony. In Eastern Orthodox funerals, the coffins are reopened just before burial to allow mourners to look at the deceased one last time and give their final farewells. Greek funerals are an exception as the coffin is open during the whole procedure unless the state of the body does not allow it. Morticians may ensure that all jewelry, including wristwatch, that were displayed at the wake are in the casket before it is buried or entombed. Custom requires that everything goes into the ground; however this is not true for Jewish services. Jewish tradition stipulates that nothing of value is buried with the deceased. In the case of cremation such items are usually removed before the body goes into the furnace. Pacemakers are removed prior to cremation \u2013 if left in they could explode. Funerals for indigenous people, like many other cultures, are a method to remember, commemorate and respect the dead through their own cultural practices and traditions. In the past, there has been scrutiny when the topic of indigenous funeral sites was approached. Thus the federal government deemed it necessary to include a series of acts that would protect and accurately affiliate some of these burials with their correct native individuals or groups. This was enacted through the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. Furthermore, in 2001 California created the California Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act that would \"require all state agencies and museums that receive state funding and that have possession or control over collections of humans remains or cultural items to provide a process for identification and repatriates of these items to appropriate tribes.\" In 2020, it was amended to include tribes that were beyond State and Federal knowledge. In the Ipai, Tipai, Paipai, and Kiliwa regions funeral practices are similar in their social and power dynamics. The way that these funeral sites were created was based on previous habitation. Meaning, these were sites were their peoples may have died or if they had been a temporary home for some of these groups.[71] Additionally, these individual burials were characterized by grave markers and/or grave offerings. The markers included inverted metates, fractured pieces of metates as well as cairns. As for offerings, food, shell and stone beads were often found in burial mounds along with portions human remains. The state of the human remains found at the site can vary, data suggests[71] that cremations are recent in prehistory compared to just burials. Ranging from the middle Holocene era to the Late Prehistoric Period. Additionally, the position these people were placed in plays a role in how the afterlife was viewed. With recent ethnographic evidence coming from the Yuman people, it is believed that the spirits of the dead could potentially harm the living. so, they would often layer the markers or offerings above the body so that they would be unable to \"leave\" their graves and enact harm. In the Los Angeles Basin, researchers discovered communal mourning features at West Bluffs and Landing Hill. These communal mourning rituals were estimated to have taken place during the Intermediate Period (3,000-1,000 B.P.). Archaeologists have found fragmented pieces of a large schist pestle which was deliberately broken in a methodical way. Other fragmented vessels show signs of uneven burning on the interior surface presumed to have been caused by burning combustible material. In the West Bluffs and Landing Hill assemblages there are many instances of artifacts that were dyed in red ochre pigment after being broken. The tradition of intentionally breaking objects has been a custom in the region for thousands of  years for the purpose of releasing the spirit within the object, reducing harm to the community, or as an expression of grief. Pigmentation of grave goods also has many interpretations, the Chumash associate the color red with both earth and fire. While some researchers consider the usage of the red pigment as an important transitional moment in the adult life cycle.[72] A memorial service[73] or memorial gathering is one given for the deceased, often without the body present. The service takes place after cremation or burial at sea, after an entombment in a mausoleum's crypt, after donation of the body to an academic or research institution, after a traditional burial in a cemetery plot (remains either in a coffin or an urn) or after the ashes have been scattered someplace. It is also significant when the person is missing and presumed dead, or known to be deceased though the body is not recoverable. These services often take place at a funeral home;[74] however, they can be held in a home, cemetery chapel, university, town hall, country club, restaurant, beach, community center, workplace, place of worship, hospital chapel, health club, performing arts center, wedding chapel, national park, townhouse, civic center, hotel, museum, sports field, pub, urban park or other location of some significance.[75][76] A memorial service may include speeches (eulogies), prayers, poems, or songs (most particularly hymns) to commemorate the deceased. Pictures of the deceased and flowers with sometimes an urn are usually placed where the coffin would normally be placed. After the sudden deaths of important public officials, public memorial services have been held by communities, including those without any specific connection to the deceased. For examples, community memorial services were held after the assassinations of US presidents James A. Garfield and William McKinley. In Finland, religious funerals (hautajaiset) are quite ascetic and typically follow Lutheran traditions.[77] The local priest or minister says prayers and blesses the deceased in their house. The mourners (saattov\u00e4ki) traditionally bring food to the mourners' house. Common current practice has the deceased placed into the coffin in the place where they died. The undertaker will pick up the coffin and place it in the hearse and drive it to the funeral home, while the closest relatives or friends of the deceased will follow the hearse in a funeral procession in their own cars. The coffin will be held at the funeral home until the day of the funeral. The funeral services may be divided into two parts. First is the church service (siunaustilaisuus) in a cemetery chapel or local church, then the burial.[78] The majority of Italians are Roman Catholic and follow Catholic funeral traditions. Historically, mourners would walk in a funeral procession to the gravesite; today vehicles are used. Greek funerals are generally held in churches, including a Trisagion service. There is usually a 40-day mourning period, and the end of which, a memorial service is held. Every year following, a similar service takes place, to mark the anniversary of the death.[79][80] In Poland, in urban areas, there are usually two, or just one \"stop\". The body, brought by a hearse from the mortuary, may be taken to a church or to a cemetery chapel. There is then a funeral mass or service at the cemetery chapel. Following the mass or Service the casket is carried in procession (usually on foot) by hearse to the grave. Once at the grave-site, the priest will commence the graveside committal service and the casket is lowered. The mass or service usually takes place at the cemetery. In some traditional rural areas, the wake (czuwanie) takes place in the house of the deceased or their relatives. The body lies in state for three days in the house. The funeral usually takes place on the third day. Family, neighbors and friends gather and pray during the day and night on those three days and nights. There are usually three stages in the funeral ceremony (ceremonia pogrzebowa, pogrzeb): the wake (czuwanie), then the body is carried by procession (usually on foot) or people drive in their own cars to the church or cemetery chapel for mass, and another procession by foot to the gravesite. After the funeral, families gather for a post-funeral get-together (stypa). It can be at the family home, or at a function hall. In Poland cremation is less popular because the Catholic Church in Poland prefers traditional burials (though cremation is allowed). Cremation is more popular among non-religious people and Protestants in Poland. An old funeral rite from the Scottish Highlands involved burying the deceased with a wooden plate resting on his chest. On the plate were placed a small amount of earth and salt, to represent the future of the deceased. The earth hinted that the body would decay and become one with the earth, while the salt represented the soul, which does not decay. This rite was known as \"earth laid upon a corpse\". This practice was also carried out in Ireland, as well as in parts of England, particularly in Leicestershire, although in England the salt was intended to prevent air from distending the corpse.[81] In Spain, a burial or cremation may occur very soon after a death. Most Spaniards are Roman Catholics and follow Catholic funeral traditions. First, family and friends sit with the deceased during the wake until the burial. Wakes are a social event and a time to laugh and honor the dead. Following the wake comes the funeral mass (Tanatorio) at the church or cemetery chapel. Following the mass is the burial. The coffin is then moved from the church to the local cemetery, often with a procession of locals walking behind the hearse. The first Swedish evangelical order of burial was given in Olaus Petri's handbook of 1529. From the medieval order, it had only kept burial and cremation.[82] The funeral where the priest blessed the recently deceased, which after the Reformation came to be called a reading, was forbidden in the church order of 1686, but was taken over by lay people instead. It was then followed by the wake, which was banned by the church law in 1686, when it was often considered degenerate to do dancing and games where beer and brandy were served.[83] It came however, to live on in the custom of \"singing out corpses\". In older times, the grave was often shoveled closed during the hymn singing. During the 17th century, homilies became common, they were later replaced by grift speeches, which, however, never became mandatory. In 1686, it was decided that those who had lived a Christian life should be honestly and properly buried in a grave. It also determined that the burial would be performed by a priest in the Church of Sweden (later some religious communities were given the right to bury their dead themselves). Burial could only take place at a burial site intended for the purpose. Loss of honorable burial became a punishment. A distinction was made between silent burial (for some serious criminals) and quiet burial without singing and bell ringing and with abbreviated ritual (for some criminals, unbaptized children and for those who committed suicide). Church burial was compulsory for members of the Church of Sweden until 1926, when the possibility was opened for civil burial.[82] In the UK, funerals are commonly held at a church, crematorium or cemetery chapel.[84] Historically, it was customary to bury the dead, but since the 1960s, cremation has been more common.[85] While there is no visitation ceremony like in North America, relatives may view the body beforehand at the funeral home. A room for viewing is usually called a chapel of rest.[86] Funerals typically last about half an hour.[87] They are sometimes split into two ceremonies: a main funeral and a shorter committal ceremony. In the latter, the coffin is either handed over to a crematorium[87] or buried in a cemetery.[88] This allows the funeral to be held at a place without cremation or burial facilities. Alternatively, the entire funeral may be held in the chapel of the crematorium or cemetery. It is not customary to view a cremation; instead, the coffin may be removed from the chapel or hidden with curtains towards the end of the funeral.[87] After the funeral, it is common for the mourners to gather for refreshments. This is sometimes called a wake, though this is different from how the term is used in other countries, where a wake is a ceremony before the funeral.[84] Traditionally, a good funeral (as they were called) had one draw the curtains for a period of time; at the wake, when new visitors arrived, they would enter from the front door and leave through the back door. The women stayed at home whilst the men attended the funeral, the village priest would then visit the family at their home to talk about the deceased and to console them.[89] The first child of William Price, a Welsh Neo-Druidic priest, died in 1884. Believing that it was wrong to bury a corpse, and thereby pollute the earth, Price decided to cremate his son's body, a practice which had been common in Celtic societies.\nThe police arrested him for the illegal disposal of a corpse.[90] Price successfully argued in court that while the law did not state that cremation was legal, it also did not state that it was illegal. The case set a precedent that, together with the activities of the newly founded Cremation Society of Great Britain, led to the Cremation Act 1902.[91] The Act imposed procedural requirements before a cremation could occur and restricted the practice to authorised places.[92] A growing number of families choose to hold a life celebration or celebration of life[93][94] event for the deceased. Like memorial services, this ceremony is held after burial, entombment or cremation of the deceased. An urn can be on display with flowers and photos on the altar after cremation like in a memorial service. Unlike funerals, the focus of the ceremony is on the life that was lived.[95] Such ceremonies may be held outside the funeral home or place of worship; country clubs, cemetery chapels, restaurants, beaches, performing arts centers, wedding chapels, urban parks, sports fields, hotels, civic centers, museums, hospital chapels, community centers, town halls, pubs and sporting facilities are popular choices based on the specific interests of the deceased. Celebrations of life focus on including the person's best qualities, interests, achievements and impact, rather than mourning a death.[93] Some events are portrayed as joyous parties, instead of a traditional somber funeral. Taking on happy and hopeful tones, celebrations of life discourage wearing black and focus on the deceased's individuality.[93] An extreme example might have \"a fully stocked open bar, catered food, and even favors.\"[94] Notable recent celebrations of life ceremonies include those for Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil[96] and Maya Angelou.[97] In Australia, funerary customs continue to evolve in response to cultural diversity and environmental awareness; see Funeral rituals and trends in Australia for details of current practices. Originating in New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S., alongside the emergence of jazz music in late 19th and early 20th centuries, the jazz funeral is a traditionally African-American burial ceremony and celebration of life unique to New Orleans that involves a parading funeral procession accompanied by a brass band playing somber hymns followed by upbeat jazz music. Traditional jazz funerals begin with a processional led by the funeral director, family, friends, and the brass band, i.e., the \"main line\", who march from the funeral service to the burial site while the band plays slow dirges and Christian hymns. After the body is buried, or \"cut loose\", the band begins to play up-tempo, joyful jazz numbers, as the main line parades through the streets and crowds of \"second liners\" join in and begin dancing and marching along, transforming the funeral into a street festival.[98] The terms \"green burial\" and \"natural burial\", used interchangeably, apply to ceremonies that aim to return the body with the earth with little to no use of artificial, non-biodegradable materials. As a concept, the idea of uniting an individual with the natural world after they die appears as old as human death itself, being widespread before the rise of the funeral industry. Holding environmentally-friendly ceremonies as a modern concept first attracted widespread attention in the 1990s. In terms of North America, the opening of the first explicitly \"green\" burial cemetery in the U.S. took place in the state of South Carolina. However, the Green Burial Council, which came into being in 2005, has based its operations out of California. The institution works to officially certify burial practices for funeral homes and cemeteries, making sure that appropriate materials are used.[99] Religiously, some adherents of the Roman Catholic Church often have particular interest in \"green\" funerals given the faith's preference to full burial of the body as well as the theological commitments to care for the environment stated in Catholic social teaching.[99] Those with concerns about the effects on the environment of traditional burial or cremation may be placed into a natural bio-degradable green burial shroud. That, in turn, sometimes gets placed into a simple coffin made of cardboard or other easily biodegradable material. Furthermore, individuals may choose their final resting place to be in a specially designed park or woodland, sometimes known as an \"ecocemetery\", and may have a tree or other item of greenery planted over their grave both as a contribution to the environment and a symbol of remembrance. Humanists UK organises a network of humanist funeral celebrants or officiants across England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and the Channel Islands[100] and a similar network is organised by the Humanist Society Scotland. Humanist officiants are trained and experienced in devising and conducting suitable ceremonies for non-religious individuals.[101] Humanist funerals recognise no \"afterlife\", but celebrate the life of the person who has died.[100] In the twenty-first century, humanist funerals were held for well-known people including Claire Rayner,[102] Keith Floyd,[103][104] Linda Smith,[105] and Ronnie Barker.[106] In areas outside of the United Kingdom, Ireland has featured an increasing number of non-religious funeral arrangements according to publications such as Dublin Live. This has occurred in parallel with a trend of increasing numbers of people carefully scripting their own funerals before they die, writing the details of their own ceremonies. The Irish Association of Funeral Directors has reported that funerals without a religious focus occur mainly in more urbanized areas in contrast to rural territories.[107] Notably, humanist funerals have started to become more prominent in other nations such as the Republic of Malta, in which civil rights activist and humanist Ramon Casha had a large scale event at the Radisson Blu Golden Sands resort devoted to laying him to rest. Although such non-religious ceremonies are \"a rare scene in Maltese society\" due to the large role of the Roman Catholic Church within that country's culture, according to Lovin Malta, \"more and more Maltese people want to know about alternative forms of burial... without any religion being involved\".[108][109] Actual events during non-religious funerals vary, but they frequently reflect upon the interests and personality of the deceased. For example, the humanist ceremony for the aforementioned Keith Floyd, a restaurateur and television personality, included a reading of Rudyard Kipling's poetic work \"If\u2014\" and a performance by musician Bill Padley.[103] Organizations such as the Irish Institute of Celebrants have stated that more and more regular individuals request training for administering funeral ceremonies, instead of leaving things to other individuals.[107] More recently, some commercial organisations offer civil funerals that can integrate traditionally religious content.[110] Funerals specifically for fallen members of fire or police services are common in United States and Canada. These funerals involve honour guards from police forces and/or fire services from across the country and sometimes from overseas.[111] A parade of officers often precedes or follows the hearse carrying the fallen comrade.[111] A traditional fire department funeral consists of two raised aerial ladders.[112] The firefighters travel under the aerials on their ride, on the fire apparatus, to the cemetery. Once there, the grave service includes the playing of bagpipes. The pipes have come to be a distinguishing feature of a fallen hero's funeral. Also a \"Last Alarm Bell\" is rung. A portable fire department bell is tolled at the conclusion of the ceremony. A Masonic funeral is held at the request of a departed Mason or family member. The service may be held in any of the usual places or a Lodge room with committal at graveside, or the complete service can be performed at any of the aforementioned places without a separate committal. Freemasonry does not require a Masonic funeral. There is no single convention for a Masonic funeral service. Some Grand Lodges have a prescribed service (as it is a worldwide organisation). Some of the customs include the presiding officer wearing a hat while doing his part in the service, the Lodge members placing sprigs of evergreen on the casket, and a small white leather apron may being placed in or on the casket. The hat may be worn because it is Masonic custom (in some places in the world) for the presiding officer to have his head covered while officiating. To Masons, the sprig of evergreen is a symbol of immortality. A Mason wears a white leather apron, called a \"lambskin\", on becoming a Mason, and he may continue to wear it even in death.[113][114] In most East Asian, South Asian and many Southeast Asian cultures, the wearing of white is symbolic of death. In these societies, white or off-white robes are traditionally worn to symbolize that someone has died and can be seen worn among relatives of the deceased during a funeral ceremony. In Chinese culture, red is strictly forbidden as it is a traditionally symbolic color of happiness. Exceptions are sometimes made if the deceased has reached an advanced age such as 85, in which case the funeral is considered a celebration, where wearing white with some red is acceptable. Contemporary Western influence however has meant that dark-colored or black attire is now often also acceptable for mourners to wear (particularly for those outside the family). In such cases, mourners wearing dark colors at times may also wear a white or off-white armband or white robe. Contemporary South Korean funerals typically mix western culture with traditional Korean culture, largely depending on socio-economic status, region, and religion. In almost all cases, all related males in the family wear woven armbands representing seniority and lineage in relation to the deceased, and must grieve next to the deceased for a period of three days before burying the body. During this period of time, it is customary for the males in the family to personally greet all who come to show respect. While burials have been preferred historically, recent trends show a dramatic increase in cremations due to shortages of proper burial sites and difficulties in maintaining a traditional grave. The ashes of the cremated corpse are commonly stored in columbaria. Most Japanese funerals are conducted with Buddhist and/or Shinto rites.[115] Many ritually bestow a new name on the deceased; funerary names typically use obsolete or archaic kanji and words, to avoid the likelihood of the name being used in ordinary speech or writing. The new names are typically chosen by a Buddhist priest, after consulting the family of the deceased. Religious thought among the Japanese people is generally a blend of Shint\u014d and Buddhist beliefs. In modern practice, specific rites concerning an individual's passage through life are generally ascribed to one of these two faiths. Funerals and follow-up memorial services fall under the purview of Buddhist ritual, and 90% Japanese funerals are conducted in a Buddhist manner[?]. Aside from the religious aspect, a Japanese funeral usually includes a wake, the cremation of the deceased, and inclusion within the family grave. Follow-up services are then performed by a Buddhist priest on specific anniversaries after death. According to an estimate in 2005, 99% of all deceased Japanese are cremated.[116] In most cases the cremated remains are placed in an urn and then deposited in a family grave. In recent years however, alternative methods of disposal have become more popular, including scattering of the ashes, burial in outer space, and conversion of the cremated remains into a diamond that can be set in jewelry. Funeral practices and burial customs in the Philippines encompass a wide range of personal, cultural, and traditional beliefs and practices which Filipinos observe in relation to death, bereavement, and the proper honoring, interment, and remembrance of the dead. These practices have been vastly shaped by the variety of religions and cultures that entered the Philippines throughout its complex history. Most if not all present-day Filipinos, like their ancestors, believe in some form of an afterlife and give considerable attention to honouring the dead.[117] Except amongst Filipino Muslims (who are obliged to bury a corpse less than 24 hours after death), a wake is generally held from three days to a week.[118] Wakes in rural areas are usually held in the home, while in urban settings the dead is typically displayed in a funeral home. Friends and neighbors bring food to the family, such as pancit noodles and bibingka cake; any leftovers are never taken home by guests, because of a superstition against it.[44] Apart from spreading the news about someone's death verbally,[118] obituaries are also published in newspapers. Although the majority of the Filipino people are Christians,[119] they have retained some traditional indigenous beliefs concerning death.[120][121] In Korea, funerals are typically held for three days and different things are done in each day. The first day: on the day a person dies, the body is moved to a funeral hall. They prepare clothes for the body and put them into a chapel of rest. Then food is prepared for the deceased. It is made up of three bowls of rice and three kinds of Korean side dishes. Also, there has to be three coins and three straw shoes. This can be cancelled if the family of the dead person have a particular religion.[122] On the second day the funeral director washes the body and shrouding is done. Then, a family member of the dead person puts uncooked rice in the mouth of the body. This step does not have to be done if the family has a certain religion. After putting the rice in the mouth, the body is moved into a coffin. Family members, including close relatives, of the dead person will wear mourning clothing. Typically, mourning for a woman includes Korean traditional clothes, Hanbok, and mourning for man includes a suit. The color has to be black. The ritual ceremony begins when they are done with changing clothes and preparing foods for the dead person. The ritual ceremony is different depending on their religion. After the ritual ceremony family members will start to greet guests.[123] On the third day, the family decides whether to bury the body in the ground or cremate the body. In the case of burial, three family members sprinkle dirt on the coffin three times. In the case of cremation, there is no specific ritual; the only requirement is a jar to store burned bones and a place to keep the jar. Other than these facts, in Korea, people who come to the funeral bring condolence money. Also, a food called Yukgaejang is served to guests, oftentimes with the Korean distilled drink called soju.[124] In Mongolia, like many other cultures, funeral practices are considered extremely important.[citation needed], possessing significant elements of both native Mongolian rituals and Buddhist tradition.[125] For Mongolians who are very strict about tradition, families choose from three different ways of burial: open-air burial which is most common, cremation, and embalming. Many factors go into deciding which funeral practice to do. These consisted of the family's social standing, the cause of death, and the place of death. Embalming was mainly chosen by members of the Lamaistic Church; by choosing this practice, they are usually buried in a sitting position. This would show that they would always be in the position of prayer. Also, more important people such as nobles would be buried with weapons, horses and food in their coffins to help them prepare for the next world.[126] The coffin is designed and built by three to four relatives, mainly men. The builders bring planks to the hut where the dead is located and put together the box and the lid. The same people who build the coffin also decorate the funeral. Most of this work is done after dusk. With specific instruction, they work on decorations inside the youngest daughter's house. The reason for this is so the deceased is not disturbed at night.[127] In Vietnam, Buddhism is the most commonly practiced religion, however, most burial methods do not coincide with the Buddhist belief of cremation.[128] The body of the deceased is moved to a loved one's house and placed in an expensive coffin. The body usually stays there for about three days, allowing time for people to visit and place gifts in the mouth.[128] This stems from the Vietnamese belief that the dead should be surrounded by their family. This belief goes so far as to include superstition as well. If somebody is dying in Vietnamese culture, they are rushed home from the hospital so they can die there, because if they die away from home it is believed to be bad luck to take a corpse home.[129] Many services are also held in the Vietnamese burial practices. One is held before moving the coffin from the home and the other is held at the burial site.[130] After the burial of the loved one, incense is burned at the gravesite and respect is paid to all the nearby graves. Following this, the family and friends return to the home and enjoy a feast to celebrate the life of the recently departed.[130] Even after the deceased has been buried, the respect and honor continues. For the first 49 days after the burying, the family holds a memorial service every 7 days, where the family and friends come back together to celebrate the life of their loved one. After this, they meet again on the 100th day after the death, then 265 days after the death, and finally they meet on the anniversary of the death of their loved one, a whole year later, to continue to celebrate the glorious life of their recently departed.[131] The Vietnamese funeral, or \u0111\u00e1m gi\u1ed7, is a less somber occasion than most traditional Western funerals. The \u0111\u00e1m gi\u1ed7 is a celebration of the deceased's life and is centered around the deceased's family.[132] Family members might wear a traditional garment called a mourning headband to signify their relationship with the deceased. Typical mourning headbands are thin strips of fabric that are wrapped around the wearer's head. Traditionally, the deceased's closest family members, such as children, siblings, spouses, and parents will wear white mourning headbands. More distant family members' headband colors may vary. In some cultures, the deceased's nieces, nephews, or grandchildren may be required to wear white headbands with red dots. Other societies may encourage grandchildren to wear white headbands with blue dots. Fourth generation grandchildren often wear yellow mourning headbands. The use of mourning headbands emphasizes the importance of personal and familial roles in Vietnamese society. It also allows funeral attendants to carefully choose their interactions and offer condolences to those closest to the deceased.[133] Traditionally, attendants of a Vietnamese funeral service are encouraged to wear the color white. In many East Asian cultures, white is viewed as a sign of loss and mourning. In Vietnam, members of the Caodaist faith believe that white represents purity and the ability to communicate beyond spiritual worlds.[134] African funerals are usually open to many visitors. The custom of burying the dead in the floor of dwelling-houses has been to some degree prevalent on the Gold Coast of Africa. The ceremony depends on the traditions of the ethnicity the deceased belonged to. The funeral may last for as much as a week. Another custom, a kind of memorial, frequently takes place seven years after the person's death. These funerals and especially the memorials may be extremely expensive for the family in question. Cattle, sheep, goats, and poultry, may be offered and then consumed. The Ashanti and Akan ethnic groups in Ghana typically wear red and black during funerals. For special family members, there is typically a funeral celebration with singing and dancing to honor the life of the deceased. Afterwards, the Akan hold a sombre funeral procession and burial with intense displays of sorrow. Other funerals in Ghana are held with the deceased put in elaborate Fantasy coffins colored and shaped after a certain object, such as a fish, crab, boat, and even airplanes.[131] The Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop in Teshie, named after Seth Kane Kwei who invented this new style of coffin, has become an international reference for this form of art. Evidence of Africa's earliest funeral was found in Kenya in 2021. A 78,000 year old Middle Stone Age grave of a three-year-old child was discovered in Panga ya Saidi cave complex, Kenya. Researchers said the child's head appeared to have been laid on a pillow. The body had been laid in a fetal position.[135][136] In Kenya funerals are an expensive undertaking. Keeping bodies in morgues to allow for fund raising is a common occurrence more so in urban areas. Some families opt to bury their dead in the countryside homes instead of urban cemeteries, thus spending more money on transporting the dead. The first emperor of the Qin dynasty, Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum is located in the Lintong District of Xi'an, Shaanxi Province. Qin Shi Huang's tomb is one of the World Heritage sites in China. Its remarkable feature and size have been known as one of the most important historical sites in China.[137] Qin Shi Huang is the first emperor who united China for the first time. The mausoleum was built in 247 BCE after he became the emperor of the Qin dynasty. Ancient Chinese mausoleums have unique characteristics compared to other cultures[citation?]. Ancient Chinese thought that the soul remains even after death, (immortal soul) regarded funeral practices as an important tradition.[138] From their long history, the construction of mausoleums has developed over time, creating monumental and massive ancient emperor's tomb. Archeologists have found more than 8,000 life-sized figures resembling an army surrounding the emperor's tomb.[139] The primary purpose of the placement of Terracotta Army is to protect the emperor's tomb. The figures were composed of clay and fragments of pottery. The Terracotta Army represents soldiers, horses, government officials, and even musicians. The arrangement and the weapons they are carrying accurately represent the real formations and weapons of the time. Furthermore, facial features aren't identical, each sculpture bearing a unique look. The Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties are included as World Heritage Sites. The three Imperial Tombs of the Qin dynasty were added in 2000 and 2003.[140] The three tombs were all built in the 17th century. The tombs have been constructed to memorialize the emperors of the Qing dynasty and their ancestors. In tradition, Chinese have followed Feng Shui to build and decorate the interior. All of the tombs are strictly made following the superstition of Feng Shui. The Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties clearly show the cultural and architectural tradition that has existed in the area for more than 500 years[citation?]. In Chinese culture, the tombs were considered as a portal between the world of the living and the dead[citation?]. Chinese believed that the portal would divide the soul into two parts. The half of the soul would go to heaven, and the other half would remain within the physical body.[141] From about 1600 to 1914 Europe had two professions that have almost entirely disappeared. The mute appears in art quite frequently, but in literature is probably best known from Dickens's Oliver Twist (1837\u20131839). Oliver is working for Mr Sowerberry when characterised thus: \"There's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear... which is very interesting. He would make a delightful mute, my love.\" And in Martin Chuzzlewit (1842\u20131844), Moult, the undertaker, states: \"This promises to be one of the most impressive funerals,...no limitation of expense...I have orders to put on my whole establishment of mutes, and mutes come very dear, Mr Pecksniff\". The main function of a funeral mute was to stand around at funerals with a sad, pathetic face. A symbolic protector of the deceased, the mute would usually stand near the door of the home or church. In Victorian times, mutes would wear somber clothing including black cloaks, top hats with trailing hatbands, and gloves.[142] The professional mourner, generally a woman, would shriek and wail (often while clawing her face and tearing at her clothing), to encourage others to weep. Records document forms of professional mourning from Ancient Greece.[143][144] The 2003 award-winning Philippine comedy Crying Ladies revolves around the lives of three women who are part-time professional mourners for the Chinese-Filipino community in Manila's Chinatown. According to the film, the Chinese use professional mourners to help expedite the entry of a deceased loved one's soul into heaven by giving the impression that he or she was a good and loving person, well-loved by many. High-ranking national figures such as heads of state, prominent politicians, military figures, national heroes and eminent cultural figures may be offered state funerals. Common methods of disposal are: Some people choose to make their funeral arrangements in advance so that at the time of their death, their wishes are known to their family. However, the extent to which decisions regarding the disposition of a decedent's remains (including funeral arrangements) can be controlled by the decedent while still alive vary from one jurisdiction to another. In the United States, there are states which allow one to make these decisions for oneself if desired, for example by appointing an agent to carry out one's wishes; in other states, the law allows the decedent's next-of-kin to make the final decisions about the funeral without taking the wishes of the decedent into account.[150] The decedent may, in most U.S. jurisdictions, provide instructions as to the funeral by means of a last will and testament. These instructions can be given some legal effect if bequests are made contingent on the heirs carrying them out, with alternative gifts if they are not followed. This requires the will to become available in time; aspects of the disposition of the remains of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ran contrary to a number of his stated wishes, which were found in a safe that was not opened until after the funeral. Some people donate their bodies to a medical school for use in research or education. Medical students frequently study anatomy from donated cadavers; they are also useful in forensic research.[151] Some medical conditions, such as amputations or various surgeries can make the cadaver unsuitable for these purposes; in other cases the bodies of people who had certain medical conditions are useful for research into those conditions. Many medical schools rely on the donation of cadavers for the teaching of anatomy.[152] It is also possible to arrange for donate organs and tissue after death for treating the sick, or even whole cadavers for forensic research at body farms.",

Customs vary between cultures and religious groups. Funerals have both normative and legal components. Common secular motivations for funerals include mourning the deceased, celebrating their life, and offering support and sympathy to the bereaved; additionally, funerals may have religious aspects that are intended to help the soul of the deceased reach the afterlife, resurrection or reincarnation. The funeral usually includes a ritual through which the corpse receives a final disposition.[2] Depending on culture and religion, these can involve either the destruction of the body (for example, by cremation, sky burial, decomposition, disintegration or dissolution) or its preservation (for example, by mummification). Differing beliefs about cleanliness and the relationship between body and soul are reflected in funerary practices. A memorial service (service of remembrance or celebration of life) is a funerary ceremony that is performed without the remains of the deceased person.[3] In both a closed casket funeral[4] and a memorial service, photos of the deceased representing stages of life would be displayed on an altar. Relatives or friends would give out eulogies in both services as well.[5] The word funeral comes from the Latin funus, which had a variety of meanings, including the corpse and the funerary rites themselves. Funerary art is art produced in connection with burials, including many kinds of tombs, and objects specially made for burial like flowers with a corpse. Funeral rites pre-date modern Homo sapiens and dated to at least 300,000 years ago.[6] For example, in the Shanidar Cave in"

Funeral rites pre-date modern Homo sapiens and dated to at least 300,000 years ago.[6] For example, in the Shanidar Cave in Iraq, in Pontnewydd Cave in Wales and at other sites across Europe and the Near East,[6] Archaeologists have discovered Neanderthal skeletons with a characteristic layer of flower pollen. This deliberate burial and reverence given to the dead has been interpreted as suggesting that Neanderthals had religious beliefs,[6] although the evidence is not unequivocal \u2013 while the dead were apparently buried deliberately, burrowing rodents could have introduced the flowers.[7] Substantial cross-cultural and historical research document funeral customs as a highly predictable, stable force in communities.[8][9] Funeral customs tend to be characterized by five \"anchors\": significant symbols, gathered community, ritual action, cultural heritage, and transition of the dead body (corpse).[2] The most common venues for funeral services would be in a place of worship (synagogue or church) or a funeral home. However, a cemetery's chapel features a reflecting serene intimacy as well as a respectful environment for clergy, mourning families and friends. Graveside services are a less common option for these rituals. A mausoleum's chapel mostly intends to be for entombment after the funeral itself. These two funerary chapels both generously accommodate open or closed-casket services prior to a traditional burial within the cemetery. If a funeral is subsequently followed by cremation, the service would be in a crematorium. In the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, burial law prescribes both the location of burial and burial practices and precludes cremation of the dead.

Before interment the body should be wrapped in a shroud of silk or cotton, and a ring should be placed on its finger bearing the inscription \"I came forth from God, and return unto Him, detached from all save Him, holding fast to His Name, the Merciful, the Compassionate\". The coffin should be of crystal, stone or hard fine wood. Also, before interment, a specific Prayer for the Dead[10] is ordained. The body should be placed with the feet facing the Qiblih. The formal prayer and the ring are meant to be used for those who have reached 15 years of age. Since there are no Bah\u00e1'\u00ed clergy, services are usually conducted under the guidance, or with the assistance of, a Local Spiritual Assembly.[11][12][13] A Buddhist funeral marks the transition from one life to the next for the deceased. It also reminds the living of their own mortality. Cremation is the preferred choice,[14] although burial is also allowed. Buddhists in Tibet perform sky burials where the body is exposed to be eaten by vultures. The body is dissected with a blade on the mountain top before the exposure. Crying and wailing is discouraged and the rogyapas (body breakers who perform the ritual) laugh as if they are doing farm work.

There are many funeral norms in Christianity.[18] Burial, rather than a destructive process such as cremation, was the traditional practice amongst Christians, because of the belief in the resurrection of the body. Cremations later came into widespread use, although some denominations forbid them. The US Conference of Catholic Bishops said \"The Church earnestly recommends that the pious custom of burying the bodies of the deceased be observed; nevertheless, the Church does not prohibit cremation unless it was chosen for reasons contrary to Christian doctrine\" (canon 1176.3).[19][20] Antyesti, literally 'last rites' or 'last sacrifice', refers to the rite-of-passage rituals associated with a funeral in Hinduism.[21] It is sometimes referred to as Antima Samskaram, Antya-kriya, Anvarohanyya, or Vahni Sanskara. A dead adult Hindu is cremated, while a dead child is typically buried.[22][23] The rite of passage is said to be performed in harmony with the sacred premise that the microcosm of all living beings is a reflection of a macrocosm of the universe.[24] The soul (Atman, Brahman) is believed to be the immortal essence that is released at the Antyeshti ritual, but both the body and the"

They consist of five elements: air, water, fire, earth and space.[24] The last rite of passage returns the body to the five elements and origins.[22][24] The roots of this belief are found in the Vedas, for example in the hymns of Rigveda in section 10.16, as follows: Burn him not up, nor quite consume him, Agni: let not his body or his skin be scattered, O all possessing Fire, when thou hast matured him, then send him on his way unto the Fathers. When thou hast made him ready, all possessing Fire, then do thou give him over to the Fathers, When he attains unto the life that waits him, he shall become subject to the will of gods.

In Hindu tradition, the body is usually kept at home with the family until its time for cremation. A typical Hindu funeral includes three main stages: a gathering or wake in the home, the cremation itself\u2014referred to as mukhagni\u2014and a follow-up ritual called the shraddha ceremony.[28] The body is washed, wrapped in white cloth for a man or a widow, red for a married woman,[23] the two toes tied together with a string, a Tilak (red mark) placed on the forehead.[22] The dead adult's body is carried to the cremation ground near a river or water, by family and friends, and placed on a pyre with feet facing south.[23] The eldest son, or a male mourner, or a priest then bathes before leading the cremation ceremonial function.[22][29] He circumambulates the dry wood pyre with the body, says a eulogy or recites a hymn in some cases, places sesame seed in the dead person's mouth, sprinkles the body and the pyre with ghee (clarified butter), then draws three lines signifying Yama (deity of the dead), Kala (time, deity of cremation) and the dead.[22] The pyre is then set ablaze, while the mourners mourn. The ash from the cremation is consecrated to the nearest river or sea.[29] After the cremation, a period of mourning is observed for 10 to 12 days after which the immediate male relatives or the sons of the deceased shave their head, trim their nails, recites prayers with the help of priest or Brahmin and invite all relatives, kins, friends and neighbours to eat a simple meal together in"

During the mourning period, sleeping arrangements in the home change too. Mattresses are taken off the beds and placed on the floor, and for twelve days, everyone in the household sleeps on the floor as part of the funeral customs.[30] This day, in some communities, also marks a day when the poor and needy are offered food in memory of the dead.[31] In most Hindu communities the last day of the mourning is called as Terahveen (the thirteenth day), and on this day items of basic needs along with some favourite items of the deceased are donated to the priests. Also on the same day the eldest son of the family is ceremonially crowned (called Pagdi Rasm) for he is now the head of the family. A feast is also organised for Brahmins, family members, and friends.[32] The belief that bodies are infested by Nasu upon death greatly influenced Zoroastrian burial ceremonies and funeral rites. Burial and cremation of corpses was prohibited, as such acts would defile the sacred creations of earth and fire respectively.[33] Burial of corpses was so looked down upon that the exhumation of \"buried corpses was regarded as meritorious.\" For these reasons, \"Towers of Silence\" were developed\u2014open air, amphitheater like structures in which corpses were placed so carrion-eating birds could feed on them.

Sagd\u012bd, meaning 'seen by a dog,' is a ritual that must be performed as promptly after death as possible. The dog is able to calculate the degree of evil within the corpse, and entraps the contamination so it may not spread further, expelling Nasu from the body.[34] Nasu remains within the corpse until it has been seen by a dog, or until it has been consumed by a dog or a carrion-eating bird.[35] According to chapter 31 of the Denkard, the reasoning for the required consumption of corpses is that the evil influences of Nasu are contained within the corpse until, upon being digested, the body is changed from the form of nasa into nourishment for animals. The corpse is thereby delivered over to the animals, changing from the state of corrupted nasa to that of hixr, which is \"dry dead matter,\" considered to be less polluting. A path through which a funeral procession has traveled must not be passed again, as Nasu haunts the area thereafter, until the proper rites of banishment are performed.[36] Nasu is expelled from the area only after \"a yellow dog with four eyes, or a white dog with yellow ears\" is walked through the path three times.[37] If the dog goes unwillingly down the path, it must be walked back and forth up to nine times to ensure that Nasu has been driven off.[38] Zoroastrian ritual exposure of the dead is first known of from the writings of the mid-5th century BCE Herodotus, who observed the custom amongst Iranian expatriates in Asia Minor.

The corpse was then embalmed with wax and laid in a trench. While the discovery of ossuaries in both eastern and western Iran dating to the 5th and 4th centuries BCE indicates that bones were isolated, that this separation occurred through ritual exposure cannot be assumed: burial mounds,[39] where the bodies were wrapped in wax, have also been discovered. The tombs of the Achaemenid emperors at Naqsh-e Rustam and Pasargadae likewise suggest non-exposure, at least until the bones could be collected. According to legend (incorporated by Ferdowsi into his Shahnameh), Zoroaster is himself interred in a tomb at Balkh (in present-day Afghanistan). Writing on the culture of the Persians, Herodotus reports on the Persian burial customs performed by the Magi, which are kept secret. However, he writes that he knows they expose the body of male dead to dogs and birds of prey, then they cover the corpse in wax, and then it is buried.[40] The Achaemenid custom is recorded for the dead in the regions of Bactria, Sogdia, and Hyrcania, but not in Western Iran. The Byzantine historian Agathias has described the burial of the Sasanian general Mihr-Mihroe: \"the attendants of Mermeroes took up his body and removed it to a place outside the city and laid it there as it was, alone and uncovered according to their traditional custom, as refuse for dogs and horrible carrion\".

Funerals in Islam (called Janazah in Arabic) follow fairly specific rites. In all cases, however, sharia (Islamic religious law) calls for burial of the body, preceded by a simple ritual involving bathing and shrouding the body, followed by salat (prayer). Burial rituals should normally take place as soon as possible and include: The mourning period is 40 days long.[44] In Judaism, funerals follow fairly specific rites, though they are subject to variation in custom. Halakha calls for preparatory rituals involving bathing and shrouding the body accompanied by prayers and readings from the Hebrew Bible, and then a funeral service marked by eulogies and brief prayers, and then the lowering of the body into the grave and the filling of the grave. Traditional law and practice forbid cremation of the body; the Reform Jewish movement generally discourages cremation but does not outright forbid it.[45][46] Burial rites should normally take place as soon as possible and include: In Sikhism death is considered a natural process, an event that has absolute certainty and only happens as a direct result of God's Will or Hukam.[48] In Sikhism, birth and death are closely associated, as they are part of the cycle of human life of \"coming and going\" (Punjabi: \u0a06\u0a35\u0a23\u0a41 \u0a1c\u0a3e\u0a23\u0a3e, romanized: Aana Jaana) which"

Sikhs believe in reincarnation. Death is only the progression of the soul on its journey from God, through the created universe and back to God again. In life a Sikh is expected to constantly remember death so that they may be sufficiently prayerful, detached and righteous to break the cycle of birth and death and return to God.

Until the Christian era, when interment becomes again the only burial practice, both cremation and interment had been practiced depending on the area.[52] The ancient Greek funeral since the Homeric era included the pr\u00f3thesis (\u03c0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2), the ekphor\u00e1 (\u1f10\u03ba\u03c6\u03bf\u03c1\u03ac), the burial and the per\u00eddeipnon (\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03c0\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd). In most cases, this process is followed faithfully in Greece until today.[53] Pr\u00f3thesis is the deposition of the body of the deceased on the funeral bed and the threnody of his relatives. Today the body is placed in the casket, that is always open in Greek funerals. This part takes place in the house where the deceased had lived. An important part of the Greek tradition is the epicedium, the mournful songs that are sung by the family of the deceased along with professional mourners (who are extinct in the modern era). The deceased was watched over by his beloved the entire night before the burial, an obligatory ritual in popular thought, which is maintained still.

Ekphor\u00e1 is the process of transport of the mortal remains of the deceased from his residence to the church, nowadays, and afterward to the place of burial. The procession in the ancient times, according to the law, should have passed silently through the streets of the city. Usually certain favourite objects of the deceased were placed in the coffin in order to \"go along with him\". In certain regions, coins to pay Charon, who ferries the dead to the underworld, are also placed inside the casket. A last kiss is given to the beloved dead by the family before the coffin is closed. The Roman orator Cicero[54] describes the habit of planting flowers around the tomb as an effort to guarantee the repose of the deceased and the purification of the ground, a custom that is maintained until today. After the ceremony, the mourners return to the house of the deceased for the per\u00eddeipnon, the dinner after the burial. According to archaeological findings \u2013 traces of ash, bones of animals, shards of crockery, dishes and basins \u2013 the dinner during the classical era was also organized at the burial spot.

In addition to this, in the modern era, memorial services take place 40 days, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year after the death and from then on every year on the anniversary of the death. The relatives of the deceased, for an unspecified length of time that depends on them, are in mourning, during which women wear black clothes and men a black armband.[clarification needed] Nekysia (\u039d\u03b5\u03ba\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1), meaning the day of the dead, and Genesia (\u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1), meaning the day of the forefathers (ancestors), were yearly feasts in honour of the dead.[58][59] Nemesia (\u039d\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1) or Nemeseia (N\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1) was also a yearly feast in honour of the dead, most probably intended for averting the anger of the dead.[60][61] In ancient Rome, the eldest surviving male of the household, the pater familias, was summoned to the death-bed, where he attempted to catch and inhale the last breath of the decedent. Funerals of the socially prominent usually were undertaken by professional undertakers called libitinarii. No direct description has been passed down of Roman funeral rites. These rites usually included a public procession to the tomb or pyre where the body was to be cremated. The surviving relations bore masks bearing the images of the family's deceased ancestors.

Less well-to-do Romans could join benevolent funerary societies (collegia funeraticia) that undertook these rites on their behalf. Nine days after the disposal of the body, by burial or cremation, a feast was given (cena novendialis) and a libation poured over the grave or the ashes. Since most Romans were cremated, the ashes typically were collected in an urn and placed in a niche in a collective tomb called a columbarium (literally, \"dovecote\").[62] During this nine-day period, the house was considered to be tainted, funesta, and was hung with Taxus baccata or Mediterranean Cypress branches to warn passersby. At the end of the period, the house was swept out to symbolically purge it of the taint of death. Several Roman holidays commemorated a family's dead ancestors, including the Parentalia, held February 13 through 21, to honor the family's ancestors; and the Feast of the Lemures, held on May 9, 11, and 13, in which ghosts (larvae) were feared to be active, and the pater familias sought to appease them with offerings of beans. The Romans prohibited cremation or inhumation within the sacred boundary of the city (pomerium), for both religious and civil reasons, so that the priests might not be contaminated by touching a dead body, and that houses would not be endangered by funeral fires.

Restrictions on the length, ostentation, expense of, and behaviour during funerals and mourning gradually were enacted by a variety of lawmakers. Often the pomp and length of rites could be politically or socially motivated to advertise or aggrandise a particular kin group in Roman society. This was seen as deleterious to society and conditions for grieving were set. For instance, under some laws, women were prohibited from loud wailing or lacerating their faces and limits were introduced for expenditure on tombs and burial clothes. The Romans commonly built tombs for themselves during their lifetime. Hence these words frequently occur in ancient inscriptions, V.F. Vivus Facit, V.S.P. Vivus Sibi Posuit. The tombs of the rich usually were constructed of marble, the ground enclosed with walls, and planted around with trees. But common sepulchres usually were built below ground, and called hypogea. There were niches cut out of the walls, in which the urns were placed; these, from their resemblance to the niche of a pigeon-house, were called columbaria. Within the United States and Canada, in most cultural groups and regions, the funeral rituals can be divided into three parts: visitation, funeral, and the burial service. A home funeral (services prepared and conducted by the family, with little or no involvement from professionals) is legal in nearly every part of North America, but in the 21st century, they are uncommon in the US.[63] At the visitation (also called a \"viewing\", \"wake\" or \"calling hours\"), in Christian or secular Western custom, the body of the deceased person (or decedent) is placed on display in the casket (also called a coffin, however almost all body containers are caskets).

The viewing often takes place on one or two evenings before the funeral. In the past, it was common practice to place the casket in the decedent's home or that of a relative for viewing. This practice continues in many areas of Ireland and Scotland. The body is traditionally dressed in the decedent's best clothes. In recent times there has been more variation in what the decedent is dressed in \u2013 some people choose to be dressed in clothing more reflective of how they dressed in life. The body will often be adorned with common jewelry, such as watches, necklaces, brooches, etc. The jewelry may be taken off and given to the family of the deceased prior to burial or be buried with the deceased. Jewelry has to be removed before cremation in order to prevent damage to the crematory. The body may or may not be embalmed, depending upon such factors as the amount of time since the death has occurred, religious practices, or requirements of the place of burial. The most commonly prescribed aspects of this gathering are that the attendees sign a book kept by the deceased's survivors to record who attended. In addition, a family may choose to display photographs taken of the deceased person during his/her life (often, formal portraits with other family members and candid pictures to show \"happy times\"), prized possessions and other items representing his/her hobbies and/or accomplishments.

The viewing is either \"open casket\", in which the embalmed body of the deceased has been clothed and treated with cosmetics for display; or \"closed casket\", in which the coffin is closed. The coffin may be closed if the body was too badly damaged because of an accident or fire or other trauma, deformed from illness, if someone in the group is emotionally unable to cope with viewing the corpse, or if the deceased did not wish to be viewed. In cases such as these, a picture of the deceased, usually a formal photo, is placed atop the casket. However, this step is foreign to Judaism; Jewish funerals are held soon after death (preferably within a day or two, unless more time is needed for relatives to come), and the corpse is never displayed. Torah law forbids embalming.[64] Traditionally flowers (and music) are not sent to a grieving Jewish family as it is a reminder of the life that is now lost. The Jewish shiva tradition discourages family members from cooking, so food is brought by friends and neighbors.[44] (See also Jewish bereavement.) The decedent's closest friends and relatives who are unable to attend frequently send flowers to the viewing, with the exception of a Jewish funeral,[65] where flowers would not be appropriate (donations are often given to a charity instead).

By the middle of the century, they had grown to 15%, with over 54% of those noting a charitable contribution as the preferred method of expressing sympathy.[66] The deceased is usually transported from the funeral home to a church in a hearse, a specialized vehicle designed to carry casketed remains. The deceased is often transported in a procession (also called a funeral cort\u00e8ge), with the hearse, funeral service vehicles, and private automobiles traveling in a procession to the church or other location where the services will be held. In a number of jurisdictions, special laws cover funeral processions \u2013 such as requiring most other vehicles to give right-of-way to a funeral procession. Funeral service vehicles may be equipped with light bars and special flashers to increase their visibility on the roads. They may also all have their headlights on, to identify which vehicles are part of the cortege, although the practice also has roots in ancient Roman customs.[67] After the funeral service, if the deceased is to be buried the funeral procession will proceed to a cemetery if not already there.

Sometimes, the burial service will immediately follow the funeral, in which case a funeral procession travels from the site of the funeral to the burial site. In some other cases, the burial service is the funeral, in which case the procession might travel from the cemetery office to the grave site. Other times, the burial service takes place at a later time, when the final resting place is ready, if the death occurred in the middle of winter. If the decedent served in a branch of the Armed forces, military rites are often accorded at the burial service.[69] In many religious traditions, pallbearers, usually males who are relatives or friends of the decedent, will carry the casket from the chapel (of a funeral home or church) to the hearse, and from the hearse to the site of the burial service.[70] Most religions expect coffins to be kept closed during the burial ceremony. In Eastern Orthodox funerals, the coffins are reopened just before burial to allow mourners to look at the deceased one last time and give their final farewells.

Custom requires that everything goes into the ground; however this is not true for Jewish services. Jewish tradition stipulates that nothing of value is buried with the deceased. In the case of cremation such items are usually removed before the body goes into the furnace. Pacemakers are removed prior to cremation \u2013 if left in they could explode. Funerals for indigenous people, like many other cultures, are a method to remember, commemorate and respect the dead through their own cultural practices and traditions. In the past, there has been scrutiny when the topic of indigenous funeral sites was approached. Thus the federal government deemed it necessary to include a series of acts that would protect and accurately affiliate some of these burials with their correct native individuals or groups. This was enacted through the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. Furthermore, in 2001 California created the California Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act that would \"require all state agencies and museums that receive state funding and that have possession or control over collections of humans remains or cultural items to provide a process for identification and repatriates of these items to appropriate tribes.\" In 2020, it was amended to include tribes that were beyond State and Federal knowledge.

The markers included inverted metates, fractured pieces of metates as well as cairns. As for offerings, food, shell and stone beads were often found in burial mounds along with portions human remains. The state of the human remains found at the site can vary, data suggests[71] that cremations are recent in prehistory compared to just burials.

The tradition of intentionally breaking objects has been a custom in the region for thousands of years for the purpose of releasing the spirit within the object, reducing harm to the community, or as an expression of grief. Pigmentation of grave goods also has many interpretations, the Chumash associate the color red with both earth and fire. While some researchers consider the usage of the red pigment as an important transitional moment in the adult life cycle.[72] A memorial service[73] or memorial gathering is one given for the deceased, often without the body present. The service takes place after cremation or burial at sea, after an entombment in a mausoleum's crypt, after donation of the body to an academic or research institution, after a traditional burial in a cemetery plot (remains either in a coffin or an urn) or after the ashes have been scattered someplace.

Pictures of the deceased and flowers with sometimes an urn are usually placed where the coffin would normally be placed. After the sudden deaths of important public officials, public memorial services have been held by communities, including those without any specific connection to the deceased. For examples, community memorial services were held after the assassinations of US presidents James A. Garfield and William McKinley. In Finland, religious funerals (hautajaiset) are quite ascetic and typically follow Lutheran traditions.[77] The local priest or minister says prayers and blesses the deceased in their house. The mourners (saattov\u00e4ki) traditionally bring food to the mourners' house. Common current practice has the deceased placed into the coffin in the place where they died.

Cremation is more popular among non-religious people and Protestants in Poland. An old funeral rite from the Scottish Highlands involved burying the deceased with a wooden plate resting on his chest. On the plate were placed a small amount of earth and salt, to represent the future of the deceased. The earth hinted that the body would decay and become one with the earth, while the salt represented the soul, which does not decay. This rite was known as \"earth laid upon a corpse\". This practice was also carried out in Ireland, as well as in parts of England, particularly in Leicestershire, although in England the salt was intended to prevent air from distending the corpse.[81] In Spain, a burial or cremation may occur very soon after a death. Most Spaniards are Roman Catholics and follow Catholic funeral traditions. First, family and friends sit with the deceased during the wake until the burial. Wakes are a social event and a time to laugh and honor the dead. Following the wake comes the funeral mass (Tanatorio) at the church or cemetery chapel. Following the mass is the burial.

It was then followed by the wake, which was banned by the church law in 1686, when it was often considered degenerate to do dancing and games where beer and brandy were served.[83] It came however, to live on in the custom of \"singing out corpses\". In older times, the grave was often shoveled closed during the hymn singing. During the 17th century, homilies became common, they were later replaced by grift speeches, which, however, never became mandatory. In 1686, it was decided that those who had lived a Christian life should be honestly and properly buried in a grave. It also determined that the burial would be performed by a priest in the Church of Sweden (later some religious communities were given the right to bury their dead themselves). Burial could only take place at a burial site intended for the purpose. Loss of honorable burial became a punishment. A distinction was made between silent burial (for some serious criminals) and quiet burial without singing and bell ringing and with abbreviated ritual (for some criminals, unbaptized children and for those who committed suicide). Church burial was compulsory for members of the Church of Sweden until 1926, when the possibility was opened for civil burial.[82] In the UK, funerals are commonly held at a church, crematorium or cemetery chapel.[84] Historically, it was"

A room for viewing is usually called a chapel of rest.[86] Funerals typically last about half an hour.[87] They are sometimes split into two ceremonies: a main funeral and a shorter committal ceremony. In the latter, the coffin is either handed over to a crematorium[87] or buried in a cemetery.[88] This allows the funeral to be held at a place without cremation or burial facilities. Alternatively, the entire funeral may be held in the chapel of the crematorium or cemetery. It is not customary to view a cremation; instead, the coffin may be removed from the chapel or hidden with curtains towards the end of the funeral.[87] After the funeral, it is common for the mourners to gather for refreshments. This is sometimes called a wake, though this is different from how the term is used in other countries, where a wake is a ceremony before the funeral.[84] Traditionally, a good funeral (as they were called) had one draw the curtains for a period of time; at the wake, when new visitors arrived, they would enter from the front door and leave through the back door.

Believing that it was wrong to bury a corpse, and thereby pollute the earth, Price decided to cremate his son's body, a practice which had been common in Celtic societies. The police arrested him for the illegal disposal of a corpse.[90] Price successfully argued in court that while the law did not state that cremation was legal, it also did not state that it was illegal. The case set a precedent that, together with the activities of the newly founded Cremation Society of Great Britain, led to the Cremation Act 1902.[91] The Act imposed procedural requirements before a cremation could occur and restricted the practice to authorised places.[92] A growing number of families choose to hold a life celebration or celebration of life[93][94] event for the deceased. Like memorial services, this ceremony is held after burial, entombment or cremation of the deceased. An urn can be on display with flowers and photos on the altar after cremation like in a memorial service. Unlike funerals, the focus of the ceremony is on the life that was lived.[95] Such ceremonies may be held outside the funeral home or place of worship; country clubs, cemetery chapels, restaurants, beaches, performing arts centers, wedding chapels, urban parks, sports fields, hotels, civic centers, museums, hospital chapels, community centers, town halls, pubs and sporting facilities are popular choices based on the specific interests of the deceased.

Celebrations of life focus on including the person's best qualities, interests, achievements and impact, rather than mourning a death.[93] Some events are portrayed as joyous parties, instead of a traditional somber funeral. Taking on happy and hopeful tones, celebrations of life discourage wearing black and focus on the deceased's individuality.[93] An extreme example might have \"a fully stocked open bar, catered food, and even favors.\"[94] Notable recent celebrations of life ceremonies include those for Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil[96] and Maya Angelou.[97] In Australia, funerary customs continue to evolve in response to cultural diversity and environmental awareness; see Funeral rituals and trends in Australia for details of current practices. Originating in New Orleans, Louisiana, U.S., alongside the emergence of jazz music in late 19th and early 20th centuries, the jazz funeral is a traditionally African-American burial ceremony and celebration of life unique to New Orleans that involves a parading funeral procession accompanied by a brass band playing somber hymns followed by upbeat jazz music. Traditional jazz funerals begin with a processional led by the funeral director, family, friends, and the brass band, i.e., the \"main line\", who march from the funeral service to the burial site while the band plays slow dirges and Christian hymns. After the body is buried, or \"cut loose\", the band begins to play up-tempo, joyful jazz numbers, as the main line parades through the streets and crowds of \"second liners\" join in and begin dancing and marching along, transforming the funeral into a street festival.[98] The terms \"green burial\" and \"natural burial\", used interchangeably, apply"

As a concept, the idea of uniting an individual with the natural world after they die appears as old as human death itself, being widespread before the rise of the funeral industry. Holding environmentally-friendly ceremonies as a modern concept first attracted widespread attention in the 1990s. In terms of North America, the opening of the first explicitly \"green\" burial cemetery in the U.S. took place in the state of South Carolina. However, the Green Burial Council, which came into being in 2005, has based its operations out of California. The institution works to officially certify burial practices for funeral homes and cemeteries, making sure that appropriate materials are used.[99] Religiously, some adherents of the Roman Catholic Church often have particular interest in \"green\" funerals given the faith's preference to full burial of the body as well as the theological commitments to care for the environment stated in Catholic social teaching.[99] Those with concerns about the effects on the environment of traditional burial or cremation may be placed into a natural bio-degradable green burial shroud. That, in turn, sometimes gets placed into a simple coffin made of cardboard or other easily biodegradable material.

Humanists UK organises a network of humanist funeral celebrants or officiants across England and Wales, Northern Ireland, and the Channel Islands[100] and a similar network is organised by the Humanist Society Scotland. Humanist officiants are trained and experienced in devising and conducting suitable ceremonies for non-religious individuals.[101] Humanist funerals recognise no \"afterlife\", but celebrate the life of the person who has died.[100] In the twenty-first century, humanist funerals were held for well-known people including Claire Rayner,[102] Keith Floyd,[103][104] Linda Smith,[105] and Ronnie Barker.[106] In areas outside of the United Kingdom, Ireland has featured an increasing number of non-religious funeral arrangements according to publications such as Dublin Live. This has occurred in parallel with a trend of increasing numbers of people carefully scripting their own funerals before they die, writing the details of their own ceremonies. The Irish Association of Funeral Directors has reported that funerals without a religious focus occur mainly in more urbanized areas in contrast to rural territories.[107] Notably, humanist funerals have started to become more prominent in other nations such as the Republic of Malta, in which civil rights activist and humanist Ramon Casha had a large scale event at the Radisson Blu Golden Sands resort devoted to laying him to rest.

For example, the humanist ceremony for the aforementioned Keith Floyd, a restaurateur and television personality, included a reading of Rudyard Kipling's poetic work \"If\u2014\" and a performance by musician Bill Padley.[103] Organizations such as the Irish Institute of Celebrants have stated that more and more regular individuals request training for administering funeral ceremonies, instead of leaving things to other individuals.[107] More recently, some commercial organisations offer civil funerals that can integrate traditionally religious content.[110] Funerals specifically for fallen members of fire or police services are common in United States and Canada. These funerals involve honour guards from police forces and/or fire services from across the country and sometimes from overseas.[111] A parade of officers often precedes or follows the hearse carrying the fallen comrade.[111] A traditional fire department funeral consists of two raised aerial ladders.[112] The firefighters travel under the aerials on their ride, on the fire apparatus, to the cemetery. Once there, the grave service includes the playing of bagpipes. The pipes have come to be a distinguishing feature of a fallen hero's funeral. Also a \"Last Alarm Bell\" is rung.

The service may be held in any of the usual places or a Lodge room with committal at graveside, or the complete service can be performed at any of the aforementioned places without a separate committal. Freemasonry does not require a Masonic funeral. There is no single convention for a Masonic funeral service. Some Grand Lodges have a prescribed service (as it is a worldwide organisation). Some of the customs include the presiding officer wearing a hat while doing his part in the service, the Lodge members placing sprigs of evergreen on the casket, and a small white leather apron may being placed in or on the casket. The hat may be worn because it is Masonic custom (in some places in the world) for the presiding officer to have his head covered while officiating. To Masons, the sprig of evergreen is a symbol of immortality. A Mason wears a white leather apron, called a \"lambskin\", on becoming a Mason, and he may continue to wear it even in death.[113][114] In most East Asian, South Asian and many Southeast Asian cultures, the wearing of white is symbolic of death. In these societies, white or off-white robes are traditionally worn to symbolize that someone has died and can be seen worn among relatives of the deceased during a funeral ceremony.

Contemporary Western influence however has meant that dark-colored or black attire is now often also acceptable for mourners to wear (particularly for those outside the family). In such cases, mourners wearing dark colors at times may also wear a white or off-white armband or white robe. Contemporary South Korean funerals typically mix western culture with traditional Korean culture, largely depending on socio-economic status, region, and religion. In almost all cases, all related males in the family wear woven armbands representing seniority and lineage in relation to the deceased, and must grieve next to the deceased for a period of three days before burying the body. During this period of time, it is customary for the males in the family to personally greet all who come to show respect. While burials have been preferred historically, recent trends show a dramatic increase in cremations due to shortages of proper burial sites and difficulties in maintaining a traditional grave. The ashes of the cremated corpse are commonly stored in columbaria. Most Japanese funerals are conducted with Buddhist and/or Shinto rites.[115] Many ritually bestow a new name on the deceased; funerary names typically use obsolete or archaic kanji and words, to avoid the likelihood of the name being used in ordinary speech or writing.

In modern practice, specific rites concerning an individual's passage through life are generally ascribed to one of these two faiths. Funerals and follow-up memorial services fall under the purview of Buddhist ritual, and 90% Japanese funerals are conducted in a Buddhist manner[?]. Aside from the religious aspect, a Japanese funeral usually includes a wake, the cremation of the deceased, and inclusion within the family grave. Follow-up services are then performed by a Buddhist priest on specific anniversaries after death. According to an estimate in 2005, 99% of all deceased Japanese are cremated.[116] In most cases the cremated remains are placed in an urn and then deposited in a family grave. In recent years however, alternative methods of disposal have become more popular, including scattering of the ashes, burial in outer space, and conversion of the cremated remains into a diamond that can be set in jewelry. Funeral practices and burial customs in the Philippines encompass a wide range of personal, cultural, and traditional beliefs and practices which Filipinos observe in relation to death, bereavement, and the proper honoring, interment, and remembrance of the dead.

Friends and neighbors bring food to the family, such as pancit noodles and bibingka cake; any leftovers are never taken home by guests, because of a superstition against it.[44] Apart from spreading the news about someone's death verbally,[118] obituaries are also published in newspapers. Although the majority of the Filipino people are Christians,[119] they have retained some traditional indigenous beliefs concerning death.[120][121] In Korea, funerals are typically held for three days and different things are done in each day. The first day: on the day a person dies, the body is moved to a funeral hall. They prepare clothes for the body and put them into a chapel of rest. Then food is prepared for the deceased. It is made up of three bowls of rice and three kinds of Korean side dishes. Also, there has to be three coins and three straw shoes. This can be cancelled if the family of the dead person have a particular religion.[122] On the second day the funeral director washes the body and shrouding is done.

Typically, mourning for a woman includes Korean traditional clothes, Hanbok, and mourning for man includes a suit. The color has to be black. The ritual ceremony begins when they are done with changing clothes and preparing foods for the dead person. The ritual ceremony is different depending on their religion. After the ritual ceremony family members will start to greet guests.[123] On the third day, the family decides whether to bury the body in the ground or cremate the body. In the case of burial, three family members sprinkle dirt on the coffin three times. In the case of cremation, there is no specific ritual; the only requirement is a jar to store burned bones and a place to keep the jar. Other than these facts, in Korea, people who come to the funeral bring condolence money. Also, a food called Yukgaejang is served to guests, oftentimes with the Korean distilled drink called soju.[124] In Mongolia, like many other cultures, funeral practices are considered extremely important.[citation needed], possessing significant elements of both native Mongolian rituals and Buddhist tradition.[125] For Mongolians who are very strict about tradition, families choose from three different ways of burial: open-air burial which is most common, cremation, and embalming.

Embalming was mainly chosen by members of the Lamaistic Church; by choosing this practice, they are usually buried in a sitting position. This would show that they would always be in the position of prayer. Also, more important people such as nobles would be buried with weapons, horses and food in their coffins to help them prepare for the next world.[126] The coffin is designed and built by three to four relatives, mainly men. The builders bring planks to the hut where the dead is located and put together the box and the lid. The same people who build the coffin also decorate the funeral. Most of this work is done after dusk. With specific instruction, they work on decorations inside the youngest daughter's house. The reason for this is so the deceased is not disturbed at night.[127] In Vietnam, Buddhism is the most commonly practiced religion, however, most burial methods do not coincide with the Buddhist belief of cremation.[128] The body of the deceased is moved to a loved one's house and placed in an expensive coffin. The body usually stays there for about three days, allowing time for people to visit and place gifts in the mouth.[128] This stems from the Vietnamese belief that the dead should be surrounded by their family.

One is held before moving the coffin from the home and the other is held at the burial site.[130] After the burial of the loved one, incense is burned at the gravesite and respect is paid to all the nearby graves. Following this, the family and friends return to the home and enjoy a feast to celebrate the life of the recently departed.[130] Even after the deceased has been buried, the respect and honor continues. For the first 49 days after the burying, the family holds a memorial service every 7 days, where the family and friends come back together to celebrate the life of their loved one. After this, they meet again on the 100th day after the death, then 265 days after the death, and finally they meet on the anniversary of the death of their loved one, a whole year later, to continue to celebrate the glorious life of their recently departed.[131] The Vietnamese funeral, or \u0111\u00e1m gi\u1ed7, is a less somber occasion than most traditional Western funerals.

Other societies may encourage grandchildren to wear white headbands with blue dots. Fourth generation grandchildren often wear yellow mourning headbands. The use of mourning headbands emphasizes the importance of personal and familial roles in Vietnamese society. It also allows funeral attendants to carefully choose their interactions and offer condolences to those closest to the deceased.[133] Traditionally, attendants of a Vietnamese funeral service are encouraged to wear the color white. In many East Asian cultures, white is viewed as a sign of loss and mourning.

The mausoleum was built in 247 BCE after he became the emperor of the Qin dynasty. Ancient Chinese mausoleums have unique characteristics compared to other cultures[citation?]. Ancient Chinese thought that the soul remains even after death, (immortal soul) regarded funeral practices as an important tradition.[138] From their long history, the construction of mausoleums has developed over time, creating monumental and massive ancient emperor's tomb. Archeologists have found more than 8,000 life-sized figures resembling an army surrounding the emperor's tomb.[139] The primary purpose of the placement of Terracotta Army is to protect the emperor's tomb.

The arrangement and the weapons they are carrying accurately represent the real formations and weapons of the time. Furthermore, facial features aren't identical, each sculpture bearing a unique look. The Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties are included as World Heritage Sites. The three Imperial Tombs of the Qin dynasty were added in 2000 and 2003.[140] The three tombs were all built in the 17th century. The tombs have been constructed to memorialize the emperors of the Qing dynasty and their ancestors. In tradition, Chinese have followed Feng Shui to build and decorate the interior.

All of the tombs are strictly made following the superstition of Feng Shui. The Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties clearly show the cultural and architectural tradition that has existed in the area for more than 500 years[citation?]. In Chinese culture, the tombs were considered as a portal between the world of the living and the dead[citation?]. Chinese believed that the portal would divide the soul into two parts. The half of the soul would go to heaven, and the other half would remain within the physical body.[141] From about 1600 to 1914 Europe had two professions that have almost entirely disappeared. The mute appears in art quite frequently, but in literature is probably best known from Dickens's Oliver Twist (1837\u20131839). Oliver is working for Mr Sowerberry when characterised thus: \"There's an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear... which is very interesting. He would make a delightful mute, my love.\" And in Martin Chuzzlewit (1842\u20131844), Moult, the undertaker, states: \"This promises to be one of the most impressive funerals,...no limitation of expense...I have orders to put on my whole establishment of mutes, and mutes come very dear, Mr Pecksniff\". The main function of a funeral mute was to stand around at funerals with a sad, pathetic face. A symbolic protector of the deceased, the mute would usually stand near the door of the home or church. In Victorian times, mutes would wear somber clothing including black cloaks, top hats with trailing hatbands, and gloves.[142] The professional mourner, generally a woman, would shriek and wail (often while clawing her face and tearing at her clothing), to encourage others to weep. Records document forms of professional mourning from Ancient Greece.[143][144]"

Records document forms of professional mourning from Ancient Greece.[143][144] The 2003 award-winning Philippine comedy Crying Ladies revolves around the lives of three women who are part-time professional mourners for the Chinese-Filipino community in Manila's Chinatown. According to the film, the Chinese use professional mourners to help expedite the entry of a deceased loved one's soul into heaven by giving the impression that he or she was a good and loving person, well-loved by many. High-ranking national figures such as heads of state, prominent politicians, military figures, national heroes and eminent cultural figures may be offered state funerals. Common methods of disposal are: Some people choose to make their funeral arrangements in advance so that at the time of their death, their wishes are known to their family. However, the extent to which decisions regarding the disposition of a decedent's remains (including funeral arrangements) can be controlled by the decedent while still alive vary from one jurisdiction to another. In the United States, there are states which allow one to make these decisions for oneself if desired, for example by appointing an agent to carry out one's wishes; in other states, the law allows the decedent's next-of-kin to make the final decisions about the funeral without taking the wishes of the decedent into account.[150] The decedent may, in most U.S. jurisdictions, provide instructions as to the funeral by means of a last will and testament. These instructions can be given some legal effect if bequests are made contingent on the heirs carrying them out, with alternative gifts if they are"

This requires the will to become available in time; aspects of the disposition of the remains of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt ran contrary to a number of his stated wishes, which were found in a safe that was not opened until after the funeral. Some people donate their bodies to a medical school for use in research or education. Medical students frequently study anatomy from donated cadavers; they are also useful in forensic research.[151] Some medical conditions, such as amputations or various surgeries can make the cadaver unsuitable for these purposes; in other cases the bodies of people who had certain medical conditions are useful for research into those conditions. Many medical schools rely on the donation of cadavers for the teaching of anatomy.[152] It is also possible to arrange for donate organs and tissue after death for treating the sick, or even whole cadavers for forensic research at body farms."

It is the only example of a double narrative in Dickens and the first person female voice may have been influenced by the example of Charlotte Bront\u00eb's Jane Eyre, published in 1847. As a baby, she was brought up by Miss Barbary, a woman she knew as her godmother; this woman was in reality the sister of her unmarried mother, the future Lady Dedlock, and thus Esther's aunt, \"in fact if not in law.\" When her aunt dies suddenly, Esther's care is taken over by the philanthropist, John Jarndyce, who arranges for Esther to receive a sound education as a future governess. When Ada Clare and Richard Carstone, two wards in Chancery, need a home, John Jarndyce welcomes them to Bleak House, his home near St Albans. Esther joins the establishment as Ada's companion and the family's housekeeper.  Over the course of Esther's stay at Bleak House, she learns more about her family, contracts smallpox, which results in facial scarring, and learns the identity of her mother, who dies not long after. She becomes engaged to Mr. Jarndyce, her guardian, but ultimately marries a doctor named Allan Woodcourt who had fallen in love with her over the course of the novel.[1] From her first introduction as narrator, Esther is firmly established to be a shrewd but damaged and self-deprecating character; her first line contains the claim that she has difficulty writing her story because she knows she is not clever, and she repeats this claim to both her childhood doll and her new guardian Mr. Jarndyce. Throughout the novel, Esther continues to profess her shortcomings through both her narration and dialogue, often internally dismissing compliments given to her by other characters. Esther is selfless, hard-working and affectionate. She has a tendency to quickly grow fond of the characters she meets; this trait is especially obvious in her first meeting with Ada Clare, whom she refers to as \u201cmy love\u201d after only a single conversation. Esther's loving and nurturing personality is also clearly visible in her interactions with Miss Jellyby and Charley, the young girl who becomes her maid. Esther is extremely affectionate toward Charley, going so far as to nurse her back to health when she falls ill even though she contracts the disease herself as a result. However, Esther is also capable of standing up for herself. When Mr. Guppy proposes to her, for example, she deflects his offer with no small amount of scorn and dislike, going so far as to tell him that his advances are ridiculous. In 1920 silent film of the novel, Esther is portrayed by Berta Gellardi. Diana Fairfax played the role in the 1959 serial. Suzanne Burden starred as Esther in the 1985 adaptation. Later, in the  2005 BBC TV series, Esther is portrayed by Anna Maxwell Martin. An infant Esther also appears briefly in the 2015 series, Dickensian.",

                "text": "self-deprecating character; her first line contains the claim that she has difficulty writing her story because she knows she is not clever, and she repeats this claim to both her childhood doll and her new guardian Mr. Jarndyce. Throughout the novel, Esther continues to profess her shortcomings through both her narration and dialogue, often internally dismissing compliments given to her by other characters. Esther is selfless, hard-working and affectionate. She has a tendency to quickly grow fond of the characters she meets; this trait is especially obvious in her first meeting with Ada Clare, whom she refers to as \u201cmy love\u201d after only a single conversation. Esther's loving and nurturing personality is also clearly visible in her interactions with Miss Jellyby and Charley, the young girl who becomes her maid. Esther is extremely affectionate toward Charley, going so far as to nurse her back to health when she falls ill even though she contracts the disease herself as a result. However, Esther is also capable of standing up for herself. When Mr. Guppy proposes to her, for example, she deflects his offer with no small amount of scorn and dislike, going so far as to tell him that his advances are ridiculous. In 1920 silent film of the novel, Esther is portrayed by Berta Gellardi. Diana Fairfax played the role in the 1959 serial. Suzanne Burden starred as Esther in the 1985 adaptation. Later, in the 2005 BBC TV series, Esther is portrayed by Anna Maxwell Martin. An infant Esther also appears briefly in the 2015 series, Dickensian."

        "text": "D'Jalma Garnier  is a musician and composer best known for Creole and Cajun fiddle and \"outside\" musical compositions and collaborations with other artists. His musical heritage descends from the Camelia Brass Band in New Orleans led by his grandfather, D'Jalma Thomas Garnier (also spelled Ganier while with Camelia Brass Band), a legendary early jazz player noted on the Preservation Hall roster in the New Orleans French Quarter[1] and who was a trumpet player, pianist and violinist said to have taught Louis Armstrong at the New Orleans Colored Waifs' Home.[2] D'Jalma Garnier, the fiddler, composer, guitarist, and \"pedestrian scholar\" of Louisiana Creole fame, is the older brother of Tony Garnier, Bob Dylan's band leader and bass player for the Neverending Tour Band since 1989. The two brothers, along with musician Stephen \"Stevo\" Th\u00e9ard (son of Magdelene Elizabeth Garnier, and grandson of Papa Garnier) are the only descendants of Papa Garnier to become professional musicians in the legacy of this significant New Orleans musical family. D'Jalma Garnier has been the subject and contributor to many articles and documentaries about Louisiana Creole music. He plays fiddle and guitar, and has performed and recorded with many leading Creole musicians. His study of Creole fiddle playing was advanced as the result of a two-year Texas Folklife Resources Grant to study and perform with the NEA National Heritage Award winner Canray Fontenot. D'Jalma has taught this material repeatedly at the Augusta Folklife Heritage Camp in North Carolina, for Louisiana Folk Roots in Lafayette, and in other workshops at home and abroad.[3] The musical accomplishments of Garnier's heritage and work with zydeco and Cajun bands in Acadiana do not detract from his work as an ethnomusicologist of Louisiana Francophone cultures or forays into avant-garde and electronic music. He is a multi-instrumentalist who performs professionally on bass and guitar, as well as fiddle, in a variety of genres. His musical work with poets includes performances and recordings with Allen Ginsberg and Hedwig Gorski, among others. Garnier produces Passport to Modern Jazz on KRVS-FM radio to \"walk you through the gate\" of new and progressive artists.[4] Mel Bay released Garnier's 2009 book, a method book with a collection of 14 songs by the masters of Louisiana Creole fiddle music, and an instructional DVD with supplemental performances. The songs were chosen because they are either the first ones people tend to learn, were written by a master and have many possibilities for variations, or cover related styles. The method covers the technique step-by-step along with tricks necessary to perform the music. Garnier created sheet music for many Creole folk classics. The transcriptions are unique for this music genre because these songs have been passed down from player to player and learned by ear. This volume is a rich sampling of core material from Louisiana roots music. The late Canray Fontenot is the best known Creole fiddler, and much of this book is infused with his legacy, including five of his compositions and a video clip. Mr. Garnier has included two of his own tunes, and the rest are by pioneer Louisiana fiddlers of the past\u2014Am\u00e9d\u00e9 Ardoin, B\u00e9b\u00e9 Carri\u00e8re, and Dennis McGee, along with zydeco favorite Boozoo Chavis. The method part of the book explains Creole fiddle technique, including bowing, cross bowing, fingering, double stops, and scratching, helping the reader learn to play in a Louisiana style. Along with learning to play solo, information is included on working with accordion players, a second fiddle, guitarists, starting a tune in a group and other tips about working with bands, and amplification. Additional resources are available when playing the disc on a computer.[5]",

        "text": "Juanne Hugo Smith (born 30 July 1981) is a South African former professional rugby union player who represented South Africa in international test rugby, the Cheetahs in the Super Rugby competition, and the Free State Cheetahs in the Currie Cup. He mainly played as a blindside flanker, although he has also played number eight. Smith made his international debut for South Africa on 7 June 2003 as a reserve in the 29\u201325 victory over Scotland at Kings Park Stadium in Durban. He was also named in the Springboks' team for the second Scottish Test the following week. He then played at number 8 during the 2003 Tri Nations Series against Australia and the All Blacks. Smith was included in the Springboks squad for the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia. He played in four matches at the World Cup and scored a try in the match against Manu Samoa. Although he only played the one Test for South Africa during 2004 \u2013 against Wales at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff in November, he was capped 10 times for the Springboks the following season. He was a reserve in matches against Uruguay and France, before being moving up into the starting line-up again as a flanker for the 2005 Tri Nations Series. The Free State Cheetahs made it to the 2005 Currie Cup final, where they defeated the Blue Bulls to win the championship. He then played in the 20\u201316 loss against France at Stade de France in Paris. The Cheetahs gained entrance into the Super 14, and competed in the 2006 season. Smith captained the side, which ended up doing remarkably well for a new team, and the Cheetahs finished above the other new team, the Western Force, as well as three other Super 14 teams. He played in the 2006 mid-year rugby tests wins over Scotland, as well as the loss against France in South Africa, then being named in the Springboks' 2006 Tri Nations Series squad. Smith was a key part of the World Cup-winning team to lift the Webb Ellis trophy in 2007. Although Smith wears the number seven on the back of his shirt, implying that he is an open side flanker, he is actually a blindside flanker, as the custom in South Africa is for openside to wear the number six rather than seven. Renowned for his strong ball carrying, Smith is one of the best blindside flankers in the world. On 25 February 2011, in a Super Rugby match against the Bulls in Bloemfontein, Smith tore his Achilles tendon, which caused him to miss the rest of the 2011 Super Rugby season, as well as the Tri Nations and the 2011 Rugby World Cup. In April 2012, Smith announced that he would be taking an indefinite break from rugby due to the ongoing battle with his Achilles injury.[1] He had had four operations on the injury but was concerned that the recovery was taking longer than he had hoped. \"The right thing to do now is to give my injury sufficient time to heal 100%,\" Smith said in an interview with the Volksblad newspaper.[1] Despite making his long-awaited comeback for the Cheetahs playing against the Bulls in a pre-season game in February 2013, the results of a subsequent MRI scan forced Smith to announce his retirement from the game.[2][3] On 10 September 2013 it was announced that Smith had been persuaded to come out of retirement and had signed a deal with RC Toulonnais.[4] Smith's 2013 season return to rugby resembles a fairytale story.  Returning from a career ending injury to an unprecedentedly successful season, Toulon won the Heineken Cup, becoming only the third team ever to retain the title.  On 24 May 2014, Smith scored the decisive try in the 60th minute of the final against Saracens.[5] He also played a crucial part in the final of the French Top 14 a week later on 31 May 2014, in which Toulon defeated Castres Olympique to win the title for the first time since 1992.[6] Subsequently, and capping a remarkable comeback year, on 6 August 2014, Smith was recalled to the Springboks team for the Rugby Championship against New Zealand, Australia and Argentina.[7]\nIn 2015 Smith again won the European Rugby Champions Cup with Toulon. Smith then had a short stint in Japan with Toyota Verblitz, but left citing family reasons,[8] and retired from all rugby in 2017.[9]",

His preferred technique included using an anteromedial portal to drill the femoral tunnel (rather than a transtibial drilling technique).[13] After his surgical retirement in the early 2010s, Cross teamed up with his son Tom and others to trial a new non-surgical technique for managing ACL injuries where the knee is braced at 90 degrees for six weeks to promote healing in the anatomical position.[14][15] Cross was awarded an Order of Australia Medal (OAM) for his revolutionary work in knee surgery.[16] He was one of the inaugural Honorary Fellows of the Australasian College of Sport and Exercise Physicians.

The building was constructed in 1842 and originally owned by Arunagiri Mudaliar.[1][2][3] In 1856, the structure and its outlying grounds covering a total of 14 acres were brought for \u20b9 21,000 and was converted into the headquarters of the first Police Commissioner of Madras, Lieutenant-Colonel John Carne Boulderson.[4] The building remained the Madras Commissioner's office until 2013.[2] The building was initially about to be demolished.[3] However, the Tamil Nadu Police Housing Corporation, Reach Foundation and Conservation Mainstream later considered the adaptive reuse of the building.[3] Restoration works began in October 2020 and completed in 9 months.[3] The heritage structure was converted into a museum in September 2021 at a cost of \u20b9 64.7 million.[2] The museum is a two-storied Indo-Saracenic structure,[3][4] consisting of high parapet walls, wooden spiral stairway, Madras terrace roofing, and traditional lime-plastered walls.[1] The grand portico at the entrance features Doric columns.[4] The interiors feature massive louvred doors that open in from the deep verandah running around the building.[3] The first high-ceiling hall of the building features wooden beams.[4] A red baize-lined wooden staircase leads to the upper storey.[3] The first curator of the museum is Steve Borgia[2] and the present government-appointed curator is D. Bharath Raj, followed by M.Kodhandan. The Newly appointed Curator by the present government is Tmt.S.Dhanalakshmi[5] Almost 200-year-old artifacts are exhibited in the museum.[2] All of the artifacts were collected from various police stations and none of them was purchased.[2] Exhibits at the museum includes a blue Plymouth Belvedere, once the car that Police Commissioners and Chiefs travelled to work in, parked at the portico; a parade of vehicles that were used as a means of transport by the beat constable (penny-farthing bicycle), the despatcher (Royal Enfield bike), and coastal security personnel (motorised speedboat); landmark cases dealt by the city's police department displayed in the first hall (including the 1965 anti-Hindi agitation, the 1975 LIC building fire, and images depicting the 1982 event of the LTTE chief V. Prabakaran and PLOTE leader Uma Maheswaran shooting at each other in Pondy Bazaar); a wall panel depicting the Auto Shankar case; a model sub-jail; mannequins displaying Sam Browne belts and sola topees and the uniforms of the various wings; musical instruments of the police bandsman; rare temple sculptures recovered by the department's idol wing; a confidential document copier from the 1900s; primitive wireless sets; 1955 photographs of uniformed men in mitre-shaped caps and shorts in the control room; and a battery of guns ranging from the old faithful 303 to a Bren light-machine, along with Winchester and 12-bore bullets.[1][3][4] The museum also displays artifacts seized from sandalwood smuggler Veerappan and LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran.[2] Former Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa's bullet-proof sports utility vehicle (SUV) is also on display.[3] A time-map charting out the evolution of the law enforcement department beginning from the Sangam era, through the poligars and the Vellore Mutiny, and the establishment of the various departments such as the Chief Office in 1865, the criminal investigation department, women's battalions, the fingerprint and the State crime records bureau.[3] It also includes depictions of the police involvement in flood relief and COVID-19 regulations.[3] Ceremonial swords, cameras that have captured crime scenes, riot gear, explosives, manacles, handcuffs and service medals are also on display.[3] The far end of the building displays a series of burnished brass bells used by firemen as different alarms.[3]",

He started his career as a teacher in Maastricht but moved to Antwerp in 1964, where he studied theater improvisation in what later was known as the Studio Herman Teirlinck.

Some of his other more recognizable work include Ramona and Halleluja!, Mira, Turks Fruit, Soldier of Orange, De Leeuw van Vlaanderen and Boerenpsalm. In the course of his career he performed in more than 150 films between 1967 and 2008. Andr\u00e9 has played roles in classical theater pieces written by such playwrights as Shakespeare, Harold Pinter, Chekhov and Samuel Beckett. Although mostly playing supporting roles, he has also taken some leading roles in plays like the farmer in Het gezin van Paemel by Cyriel Buysse. He was known for his rather cautious diction and soft timbre which later on presented him with the monologues in De Kontrabass by Patrick S\u00fcskind. He played as an actor in such theaters as Antwerp KNS, Groot Limburgs Toneel, the International Nieuwe Sc\u00e8ne, Arca and eventually at the Brussels City Theatre.

        "text": "The Grey House at 85 Swains Lane in Highgate in north London, is a house built in 2008 by the architectural firm Eldridge Smerin. The house was one of the 97 recipients of the RIBA Award in 2009 and was shortlisted for RIBA's London Building of the Year award.[1][2] The house overlooks the West Side of Highgate Cemetery.[3] In the late 1960s the site was occupied by the Dissenter's Catacombs and owned by the London Cemetery Company.[2] The catacomb was declared unsafe in 1967 and demolished. The coffins were removed.[2] Three houses were built on the site in the late 1960s; the land having been sold due to the financial precariousness of the cemetery.[4] A 99-year lease was taken on the site in 1967 with plans for a house on the site by John Winter which was never built.[2] Winter subsequently built a house on the site in 1981.[5] The 1981 house had a nautical appearance with blue cladding with white steel framing and large porthole windows. It was described as a \"quirky box of tricks\" by Building Design magazine.[2] The house was built on poor quality soil and its proximity to graves caused structural issues.[2] The house was built around a central concrete pillar and the first floor was \"[trussed] up\" as a cantilever.[2] The house was eventually supported by the cemetery wall after the cantilever failed.[2] The house was sold in 1998 for \u00a3520,000 to Richard Elliott, a photographer, chartered surveyor and developer who eventually built the present property.[4][6] Elliott lived in the 1981 house for seven years and received planning permission for two separate remodelling schemes in the early 2000s, but he eventually decided to demolish the property.[4][2] He subsequently commissioned a new house from Eldridge Smerin having been inspired by another house in Highgate the firm had built, The Lawns, completed in 2001.[2] The new house was completed in 2008.[2] Elliott also bought the adjoining house and redeveloped it as it had restricted the height of the new house. Its redevelopment allowed him to build an extra storey on the new house.[4] Elliott felt that living in the house was like living in an \"enchanted forest\" and that at \" ... three in the morning it's no less enchanted than at three in the afternoon\".[4] The house appeared in an episode of the BBC drama series Luther.[3] It was for sale in 2008 for \u00a35.95 million and in 2022 for \u00a37 million with the agency Knight Frank.[3] It sold in August 2025 for \u00a35 million.[7] The Friends of Highgate Cemetery and The Highgate Society were strongly opposed to the construction of the house following the announcement of the initial design. A trustee of the Friends of Highgate Cemetery described it as a \"totally unacceptable intrusion on the privacy of the Cemetery,\" which showed \"complete disrespect towards the grave owners\".[2] It was described as \"an excessive and overwhelming massing of buildings\" by The Highgate Society. English Heritage objected to the proposed additional floor, which would overlook the cemetery.[2] The objections were disregarded by Camden London Borough Council as they felt that the design \"illustrates an inherently sensitive grasp of the site's context ... unique and responsive, but suitably neutral\" and that \"small intervention is not so significant\" due to the large size and greenery of the cemetery.[2] It has four bedrooms and four bathrooms, with three reception rooms. The basement has a home theatre and industrial equipment for the automated lighting and blinds of the house.[3] Each bedroom has a balcony.[3] The kitchen is situated on the top floor and has a retractable glass roof.[3] It is 4,162 sq ft in size.[3] The exterior to Swains Lane features steel panels and black granite which was described by The Robb Report as a \"foreboding appearance\".[3] The house has open-plan living areas and the south and west facades of the house is distinguished by a curtain wall of glass.[3][2] The Grey House has attracted praise from critics. Ian Dungavell felt it was a \"remarkable building, robustly finished ... and filled with light\" with the extensive use of glass making \"you feel like you're standing in the Cemetery itself\".[2] Writing in The Guardian, Ros Anderson felt the house was \"uncompromisingly modern and unashamedly masculine in feel\" and that the \"sharp angles cut against the soft foliage around it, but the glass reflects tree trunks and leaves, giving it a fluid, almost ethereal, feel\" but that the view from the house was \"the real attraction. ... everything focuses your attention outwards\".[4] The prominent use of glass in the Grey House followed the precedent set by John Winter's own modernist residence, 81 Swains Lane. Upon completion of the Grey House in 2008, Winter described it as \"near to being a faultless building as I have seen for a long time\" and that he was \" ... lost in admiration for the excellence of the building work and the thorough rigour of the design\".[2] Writing in the newsletter of Highgate Cemetery, Ian Dungavell described the house as a \"A strikingly modern intervention in a landscape of crumbling monuments and overgrown trees\".[2]",

It was described as a \"quirky box of tricks\" by Building Design magazine.[2] The house was built on poor quality soil and its proximity to graves caused structural issues.[2] The house was built around a central concrete pillar and the first floor was \"[trussed] up\" as a cantilever.[2] The house was eventually supported by the cemetery wall after the cantilever failed.[2] The house was sold in 1998 for \u00a3520,000 to Richard Elliott, a photographer, chartered surveyor and developer who eventually built the present property.[4][6] Elliott lived in the 1981 house for seven years and received planning permission for two separate remodelling schemes in the early 2000s, but he eventually decided to demolish the property.[4][2] He subsequently commissioned a new house from Eldridge Smerin having been inspired by another house in Highgate the firm"

Its redevelopment allowed him to build an extra storey on the new house.[4] Elliott felt that living in the house was like living in an \"enchanted forest\" and that at \" ... three in the morning it's no less enchanted than at three in the afternoon\".[4] The house appeared in an episode of the BBC drama series Luther.[3] It was for sale in 2008 for \u00a35.95 million and in 2022 for \u00a37 million with the agency Knight Frank.[3] It sold in August 2025 for \u00a35 million.[7] The Friends of Highgate Cemetery and The Highgate Society were strongly opposed to the construction of the house following the announcement of the initial design. A trustee of the Friends of Highgate Cemetery described it as a \"totally unacceptable intrusion on the privacy of the Cemetery,\" which showed \"complete disrespect towards the grave owners\".[2] It was described as \"an excessive and overwhelming massing of buildings\" by The Highgate Society. English Heritage objected to the proposed additional floor, which would overlook the cemetery.[2] The objections were disregarded by Camden London Borough Council as they felt that the design \"illustrates an inherently sensitive grasp of the site's context ... unique and responsive, but suitably neutral\" and that \"small intervention is not so significant\" due to the large size and greenery of the cemetery.[2]"

Ian Dungavell felt it was a \"remarkable building, robustly finished ... and filled with light\" with the extensive use of glass making \"you feel like you're standing in the Cemetery itself\".[2] Writing in The Guardian, Ros Anderson felt the house was \"uncompromisingly modern and unashamedly masculine in feel\" and that the \"sharp angles cut against the soft foliage around it, but the glass reflects tree trunks and leaves, giving it a fluid, almost ethereal, feel\" but that the view from the house was \"the real attraction. ... everything focuses your attention outwards\".[4] The prominent use of glass in the Grey House followed the precedent set by John Winter's own modernist residence, 81 Swains Lane. Upon completion of the Grey House in 2008, Winter described it as \"near to being a faultless building as I have seen for a long time\" and that"

Originally from Winnipeg, he began experimenting with electronic music and moved to Montreal, where he studied fine art at Concordia University in Montreal.[1] Freedman began performing and recording under the name Pete Samples. Samples' first album, An Unsent Letter, was released in 2004, and his second album, Yours Makes Mine, was released in 2007. Yours Makes Mine charted at number 10 for 2007 on the !Earshot National Campus and Community Radio Association electronic charts.[2] In 2008, Samples released a mini-album, \"The Jumper Cables\".[3] which appeared on the Electronica Top 50 charts.[4] In 2010, the project's single \"Bekonscot\" was played regularly on campus and community radio.[5] That year Samples performed at the Halifax Pop Explosion.[6] Freedman and his wife Robin McMillan moved from Montreal to Vancouver,[1] where he began experimenting with woodworking, creating small wooden furniture models in his home studio. A final album, Bekonscot, for which Freedman, as Pete Samples, wrote all of the songs, was created by recording and layering in his singing and playing of various instruments. In line with his shift in focus toward designing in wood, the album was packaged with photographs of his wooden furniture models and designs.[7] In 2011, Samples toured with Rich Aucoin, including a performance in Ottawa.[8] By 2013, Freedman's career as Pete Samples was in hiatus. He and McMillan concentrated on opening a furniture design company called Gamla in Vancouver,[9][10] specializing in pieces suitable for apartment and condo-sized spaces.[11] They moved to Bowen Island, where Freedman set up a workshop and studio.[1]",

        "text": "Niobium\u2013tin is an intermetallic compound of niobium (Nb) and tin (Sn), used industrially as a type-II superconductor. This intermetallic compound has a simple structure: A3B. It is more expensive than niobium\u2013titanium (NbTi), but remains superconducting up to a magnetic flux density of 30 teslas [T] (300,000\u00a0G),[1] compared to a limit of roughly 15\u00a0T for NbTi. Nb3Sn was discovered to be a superconductor in 1954. The material's ability to support high currents and magnetic fields was discovered in 1961 and started the era of large-scale applications of superconductivity. The critical temperature is 18.3 kelvins (\u2212254.8\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212426.7\u00a0\u00b0F). Application temperatures are commonly around 4.2\u00a0K (\u2212268.95\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212452.11\u00a0\u00b0F), the boiling point of liquid helium at atmospheric pressure. In April 2008 a record non-copper current density was claimed of 2,643\u00a0A\u00a0mm\u22122 at 12\u00a0T and 4.2\u00a0K.[2] Nb3Sn was discovered to be a superconductor in 1954, one year after the discovery of V3Si, the first example of an A3B superconductor.[3] In 1961 it was discovered that niobium\u2013tin still exhibits superconductivity at large currents and strong magnetic fields, thus becoming the first known material to support the high currents and fields necessary for making useful high-power magnets and electric power machinery.[4][5] The central solenoid and toroidal field superconducting magnets for the planned experimental ITER fusion reactor use niobium\u2013tin as a superconductor.[6] The central solenoid coil will produce a field of 13.5 teslas (135,000\u00a0G). The toroidal field coils will operate at a maximum field of 11.8\u00a0T. Estimated use is 600 metric tons (590 long tons) of Nb3Sn strands and 250 metric tonnes of NbTi strands.[7][8] At the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, extra-strong quadrupole magnets (for focussing beams) made with niobium\u2013tin are being installed in key points of the accelerator between late 2018 and early 2020.[9] Niobium tin had been proposed in 1986 as an alternative to niobium\u2013titanium, since it allowed coolants less complex than superfluid helium,[clarification needed][citation needed] but this was not pursued in order to avoid delays while competing with the then-planned US-led Superconducting Super Collider. Mechanically, Nb3Sn is extremely brittle and thus cannot be easily drawn into a wire, which is necessary for winding superconducting magnets. To overcome this, wire manufacturers typically draw down composite wires containing ductile precursors.  The \"internal tin\" process includes separate alloys of Nb, Cu and Sn.  The \"bronze\" process contains Nb in a copper\u2013tin bronze matrix.  With both processes the strand is typically drawn to final size and coiled into a solenoid or cable before heat treatment. It is only during heat treatment that the Sn reacts with the Nb to form the brittle, superconducting niobium\u2013tin compound.[10] The powder-in-tube process is also used.[2][11] The high field section of modern NMR magnets are composed of niobium\u2013tin wire. Inside a magnet the wires are subjected to high Lorentz forces as well as thermal stresses during cooling. Any strain in the niobium tin causes a decrease in the superconducting performance of the material, and can cause the brittle material to fracture. Because of this, the wires need to be as stiff as possible. The Young's modulus of niobium tin is around 140 GPa (gigapascals) at room temperature. However, the stiffness drops to as low as 50 GPa when the material is cooled below 50\u00a0K (\u2212223.2\u00a0\u00b0C; \u2212369.7\u00a0\u00b0F).[12] Engineers must therefore find ways of improving the strength of the material. Strengthening fibers are often incorporated in the composite niobium tin wires to increase their stiffness. Common strengthening materials include Inconel, stainless steel, molybdenum, and tantalum because of their high stiffness at cryogenic temperatures.[13] Since the thermal expansion coefficients of the matrix, fiber, and niobium tin are all different, significant amounts of strain can be generated after the wire is annealed and cooled all the way down to operating temperatures. This strain is referred to as the pre-strain in the wire. Since any strain in the niobium tin generally decreases the superconducting performance of the material, a proper combination of materials must be used to minimize this value. The pre-strain in a composite wire can be calculated by the formula where \u03b5m is the pre-strain, \u0394L/Lc and \u0394L/Lf are changes in length due to thermal expansion of the niobium tin conduit and strengthening fiber respectively; Vc, Vf, Vcu, and Vbz are the volume fractions of conduit, fiber, copper, and bronze; \u03c3cu,y, and \u03c3bz,y are the yield stresses of copper and bronze; and Ec, and Ef are the Young's modulus of the conduit and the fiber.[14] Since the copper and bronze matrix deforms plastically during cooldown, they apply a constant stress equal to their yield stress. The conduit and fiber, however, deform elastically by design. Commercial superconductors manufactured by the bronze process generally have a pre-strain value around 0.2% to 0.4%. The so-called strain effect causes a reduction in the superconducting properties of many materials including niobium tin. The critical strain, the maximum allowable strain over which superconductivity is lost, is given by the formula where \u03b5c is the critical strain, \u03b5co is a material dependent parameter equal to 1.5% in tension (\u22121.8% in compression) for niobium tin, B is the applied magnetic field, and Bc2m is the maximum upper critical field of the material.[15] Strain in the niobium tin causes tetragonal distortions in the crystal lattice, which changes the electron-phonon interaction spectrum. This is equivalent to an increase in disorder in the A15 crystal structure.[16] At high enough strain, around 1%, the niobium tin conduit will develop fractures and the current carrying capability of the wire will be irreversibly damaged. In most circumstances, except for high field conditions, the niobium tin conduit will fracture before the critical strain is reached. Hafnium or zirconium added to niobium\u2013tin increases the maximum current density in a magnetic field. This may allow it to be used at 16 tesla for CERN's planned Future Circular Collider.[17]",

Dolan's first performances took place at New York City's Nuyorican Poets Cafe, where he gained respect as part of HBO's Def Poetry in 2002 and won numerous slam titles.[2] He has since distanced himself from and criticized slam poetry. In 2011, he told the Boston Phoenix: Doing spoken word was the first time I ever tried to present my writing on a stage, and that's what it was good for.  It taught me some basic stage tricks that I still use \u2014 like how to change my voice and talk to a crowd. But once you've picked up those chops, you need to get the hell out before you become some asshole who wins the poetry slam for the 10th year in a row.[2] After performing at a Def Jam industry party at the Rush Arts Gallery, B. Dolan realized he wouldn't be able to work within the major label structure. Within months, he dropped out of welder's college, bought a drum machine, and began recording the first album The Failure.[2] During this time, he slept on \"park benches and subway trains\" while working as a doorman at a building in close proximity to the Twin Towers. It was at this time that the September 11 attacks happened, leaving B. Dolan in a \"paranoid mental state\", which caused him to move back to Rhode Island.[1] Once back in Rhode Island, B. Dolan tapped into the local arts community, volunteered for at-risk youth programs, created the consumer activist website Knowmore.org, teamed up with Sage Francis, signed to Strange Famous Records, and began to tour internationally since 2005. B. Dolan has also remained prolific as a rapper, releasing albums on Strange Famous Records since 2008 and most notably creating the \"Bombzo Way\" and \"Evel Knievel\" characters, which make surprise guest appearances at his concerts.[1][2] In 2010, he released his second album Fallen House, Sunken City, the entirety of which is produced by Alias of Anticon.[3] In 2011, B. Dolan created the package show The Church of Love & Ruin, which combined activism and art by bringing openly LGBTQ performers into the arena of hip hop, in an attempt to address homophobia in rap.[2][4] On July 10, 2015, B. Dolan released his third studio album, entitled Kill the Wolf[5], on Speech Development and Strange Famous Records.[6] This was followed with a world tour,[7] visiting the US, UK and Europe.[8] As an activist, B. Dolan is known primarily as a co-founder of Knowmore.org, a wiki devoted to connecting consumers with social responsibility information about corporations.[9] He is also an author of several articles within the website. He is especially known for an article on American Apparel's CEO Dov Charney.[9][10] In 2008, due to a lack of workers and funds, Dolan decided to take the site down. In 2016 he started a funding page to redesign the site and get it up and running again.[11][1] B. Dolan co-wrote, appeared briefly in, and composed music for the 2015 independent horror film Almost Mercy, directed and co-written by Tom DeNucci. He subsequently co-wrote and composed the score for the 2019 crime-thriller Vault, also directed and co-written by DeNucci.

Dolan tapped into the local arts community, volunteered for at-risk youth programs, created the consumer activist website Knowmore.org, teamed up with Sage Francis, signed to Strange Famous Records, and began to tour internationally since 2005. B. Dolan has also remained prolific as a rapper, releasing albums on Strange Famous Records since 2008 and most notably creating the \"Bombzo Way\" and \"Evel Knievel\" characters, which make surprise guest appearances at his concerts.[1][2] In 2010, he released his second album Fallen House, Sunken City, the entirety of which is produced by Alias of Anticon.[3] In 2011, B. Dolan created the package show The Church of Love & Ruin, which combined activism and art by bringing openly LGBTQ performers into the arena of hip hop, in an attempt to address homophobia in rap.[2][4] On July 10, 2015, B. Dolan released his third studio album, entitled Kill the Wolf[5], on Speech Development and Strange Famous Records.[6] This was followed with a world tour,[7] visiting the US, UK and Europe.[8] As an activist, B. Dolan is known primarily as a co-founder of Knowmore.org, a wiki devoted to connecting consumers with social responsibility information about corporations.[9] He is also an author of several articles within the website. He is especially known for an article on American Apparel's CEO Dov Charney.[9][10] In 2008, due to a lack of workers and funds, Dolan decided to take the site down. In 2016 he started a funding page to redesign the site and get it up and running again.[11][1] B.

        "title": "Laurie Marker",
        "text": "Laurie Marker is an American zoologist, researcher, author, educator, and one of the world's foremost cheetah experts, who founded the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF) in 1990.[1]  As executive director of CCF, among many endeavors, Marker helps rehabilitate cheetahs and reintroduce them to the wild, performs research into conservation, biology and ecology, educates groups around the world, and works toward a holistic approach to saving the cheetah and its ecosystems in the wild.[2] Before her work with CCF, Marker's career started to take off at the Wildlife Safari in the U.S., where her interest with captive cheetahs began.[2] Laurie Marker (n\u00e9e Laura Lee Bushey) was born in Detroit, Michigan and lived in Birmingham, a suburb of Detroit. Her father, Ralph, came from a farming family and was an agricultural economist and accountant. Her mother, Marline, was an elementary and high school teacher and kept the family active in the community with nonprofit work.[3] Marker's family moved to Southern California when she was four years-old. She spent her childhood surrounded by animals, learning how to care for horses, dogs, cats, rabbits, donkeys and goats. Marker's family resettled in Palos Verdes, and later in San Jose, both in Northern California (USA), in time for her to finish high school at age 16. There she solidified her love for animals, starting with her dogs, and her horse on which she competed locally.[1] She started college early at San Francisco State University, intending to become a veterinarian, but the emerging wine industry in the Napa Valley caught her eye. She enrolled in the agriculture, enology and viticulture programs at Napa Valley College. While there she re-opened the Pope Valley Winery, in Angwin, which had been closed since prohibition.[3] She also began operating a dairy goat farm.[1] Marker soon moved her wine and goat operations to Oregon, where she founded Jonicole Vineyards. In 1974, to make ends meet, she began working at the newly opened local exotic animal park, Wildlife Safari, in Winston Oregon, where her tenure spanned 16 years. She was fascinated by the cheetahs she met there, and was struck by how little was collectively known about them in the scientific community. Marker decided to extensively study the ten cheetahs at Wildlife Safari and began developing what eventually became the most successful captive breeding program in the country.[1][2] She had inadvertently become one of the world's foremost experts on cheetahs, and began teaching zoo keepers and other captive breeders her techniques, and slowly expanded her research.[1] In 1977, Marker took a trip to South West Africa (now Namibia), which contained the largest living population of wild cheetahs. She brought with her a captive-born cheetah named Khayam, in order to test her theory that captive-raised cheetahs could be taught to hunt in a wild setting, and could potentially survive if released.[2] While there, she learned that cheetahs were being killed by farmers at an unsustainable rate of around 900 per year, mostly due to the cats being misunderstood and wrongly accused of killing their livestock.[1] When Marker returned with Khayam to the U.S. several months later following their successful research project, they traveled regionally and nationally making public appearances to generate awareness for the cheetah's plight. Khayam served as the first ambassador animal for her species.[3] International Cheetah Day is now celebrated every year on December 4, Khayam's birthday, in her honor.[3] For the next ten years, Marker continued traveling to Africa to learn more about the wild cheetah's problems and what could be done to assist endangered populations.[2] From 1988 to 1991, Marker served as executive director at the Smithsonian Institution's Center for New Opportunities in Animal Health Sciences (NOAHS), in Washington DC.[3] In 1990, Marker founded the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), which began as a research outpost in a small farmhouse on some land in Otjiwarongo, Namibia.[1][3] She got the funding to purchase and start the initial facility by selling all of her possessions.[4] Marker saw the problem of saving cheetahs as a holistic issue, in which local communities, farmers and governments needed to participate together for mutual goals. She created programs to aid farmers by providing free training in predator identification and livestock husbandry techniques to increase understanding and decrease losses. CCF has since bloomed into a world-renowned ecotourism venue, and a conservation, research and education facility which reaches thousands of farmers, tens of thousands of students, and hundreds of thousands of online supporters worldwide.[5] CCF has grown from sponsors and donations over the years and now occupies over 165,000 acres of mixed-use land.[4] The facility rehabilitates and releases captured or injured wild cheetahs in Namibia, and offers a safe place for non-releasable cheetahs to live out their lives as educational ambassadors for their species. Visitors, educational groups, interns, scientific study groups, and volunteers are also accepted at the CCF Namibia facility throughout the year.[5] Another integral program began in 1994 with the Livestock Guarding Dog Program. This provides farmers an economical solution to predator conflict, in the form of specially-bred Anatolian Shepherd and Kangal livestock guarding dogs to safely keep cheetahs and other predators away from livestock, which has changed people's attitudes towards cheetahs and has been found to reduce livestock losses by 80-100%.[1][6] The program has placed over 650 dogs with farmers across Namibia and continues to expand.[6] CCF has since helped launch similar programs with sister organizations in South Africa, Botswana and Tanzania.[4] 2006 saw the creation of Future Farmers of Namibia, a program which educates and promotes sustainable farming cooperatives using an integrated system of non-lethal wildlife and ecosystem management.[1] A model farm on the CCF property houses more than 1,000 head of livestock (cows, goats and sheep) and serves to promote effective and safe animal husbandry practices, along with a creamery which showcases products from the model farm.[4] The Bushblok green energy technology project and the Biotechnology Demonstration Centre aim to bring ecological management and holistic solutions to the problems of thornbush encroachment and energy creation with sustainable land use, for local and expanding international parties.[5] CCF Namibia also houses the only cheetah genetics laboratory in Africa, the Life Technologies Conservation Genetics Laboratory, which holds the world's largest wild cheetah database of biological material samples, collected from over a thousand cheetahs.[6] There is also a fully functioning Veterinary Clinic on the premises.[3] On March 1, 2020, Marker and her team, along with the Vice President of Somaliland, Abdirahman Saylici, with Minister Shukri Bandare of the Ministry of Environment & Rural Development, and a large group of Somaliland government ministers and VIPs, officially opened a CCF branch in Hargeisa, Somaliland where the illegal trafficking of wild-caught cheetahs for the exotic pet trade has become a major problem.[4] Dozens of orphaned cheetah cubs now live at CCF's Somaliland Cheetah Safe House, where cubs are placed after being rescued from wildlife traffickers.[4] Plans are in the works and funding is being gathered for the purpose of building a large, fenced nature reserve, which will be the first national park in Somaliland, on which the rehabilitated cheetahs can be released to live wild again. Several other programs, their government liaison work, and the relationships and education that CCF has provided local farmers, land owners and stakeholders in cheetah hold-out areas has significantly reduced the killing of wild cheetahs.[1] Marker and the CCF team continues to educate, fundraise, develop holistic programs, and work with scientific bodies, governments and individuals around the world for the conservation of cheetahs in the wild. She currently has over 90 paid employees, many of which are local Namibians, working with her at CCF Namibia.[1] Another few dozen paid staff work out of the Somaliland facility, and in the US, UK and Israel.[7] In the early 1980s, with collaborators at the Smithsonian Institution's National Zoo and National Cancer Institute (USA), Marker helped identify the cheetah's lack of genetic variation, thus causing the species greater problems for survival.[2] Recognizing the issues with captive breeding difficulty and the need for exceptional record keeping to ensure the species' genetic diversity and proper selective mating protocols, in 1987 she developed the International Cheetah Studbook, a registry of captive cheetahs worldwide, and is currently the International Studbook Keeper.[2][3][8] Collaboration with the two above listed institutions lead to Marker becoming executive director of the Centre for New Opportunities in Animal Health Sciences (NOAHS), in 1988, based at Smithsonian Institution's National Zoo. She continues to serve as a NOAHS Research Fellow.[2] Since 1988, Marker has been a Member of the IUCN/SSC Conservation Specialist Group - Cheetah Species Survival Plan, and a Propagation Committee Advisor (AZA/SSP).[3] From 1991 to present she is a Member of the IUCN/SSC, Captive Breeding Specialist Group.[3] In 2001 she began work as a member of the IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Core Group.[3] In 1995 she became the Species Coordinator for the Cheetah African Preservation Program, and in 1996, a member of the Waterberg Conservancy Executive Committee, and the Namibian Veterinary Association.[3][9] Marker graduated in 2002 from Oxford University with a doctorate in zoology.[4] More recently, Marker joined the Steering Committee of the Greater Waterberg Complex, Namibia, in 2011, and the Steering Committee of the Natural Resource Department at Namibia University of Science and Tech in 2012.[3] In 2021 she became a member of the Scientific Board of the Mountain Lion Foundation, in California, USA, and was a Founding Member of the Board of Trustees for the Arabian Leopard Fund in Saudi Arabia.[3] The CCF Namibia Biotechnology Demonstration Centre and the CCF Life Technologies Conservation Genetics Laboratory both continue ground-breaking work in energy, ecology, genetic and veterinary projects.[6] Marker has authored or co-authored numerous scientific papers, across a range of topics, recently including: Recommendations for the rehabilitation and release of wild-born, captive-raised cheetahs: the importance of pre- and post-release management for optimizing survival.

She brought with her a captive-born cheetah named Khayam, in order to test her theory that captive-raised cheetahs could be taught to hunt in a wild setting, and could potentially survive if released.[2] While there, she learned that cheetahs were being killed by farmers at an unsustainable rate of around 900 per year, mostly due to the cats being misunderstood and wrongly accused of killing their livestock.[1] When Marker returned with Khayam to the U.S. several months later following their successful research project, they traveled regionally and nationally making public appearances to generate awareness for the cheetah's plight. Khayam served as the first ambassador animal for her species.[3] International Cheetah Day is now celebrated every year on"

Khayam served as the first ambassador animal for her species.[3] International Cheetah Day is now celebrated every year on December 4, Khayam's birthday, in her honor.[3] For the next ten years, Marker continued traveling to Africa to learn more about the wild cheetah's problems and what could be done to assist endangered populations.[2] From 1988 to 1991, Marker served as executive director at the Smithsonian Institution's Center for New Opportunities in Animal Health Sciences (NOAHS), in Washington DC.[3] In 1990, Marker founded the Cheetah Conservation Fund (CCF), which began as a research outpost in a small farmhouse on some land in Otjiwarongo, Namibia.[1][3] She got the funding to purchase and start the initial facility by selling all of her possessions.[4] Marker saw the problem of saving cheetahs as a holistic issue, in which local communities, farmers and governments needed to participate together for mutual goals. She created programs to aid farmers by providing free training in predator identification and livestock husbandry techniques to increase understanding and decrease losses. CCF has since bloomed into a world-renowned ecotourism venue, and a conservation, research and education facility which reaches thousands of farmers, tens of thousands of students, and hundreds of thousands of online supporters worldwide.[5] CCF has grown from sponsors and donations over the years and now occupies over 165,000 acres of mixed-use land.[4] The facility rehabilitates and releases captured or injured wild cheetahs in Namibia, and offers a safe place for non-releasable cheetahs to live out their lives as educational ambassadors for their species.

This provides farmers an economical solution to predator conflict, in the form of specially-bred Anatolian Shepherd and Kangal livestock guarding dogs to safely keep cheetahs and other predators away from livestock, which has changed people's attitudes towards cheetahs and has been found to reduce livestock losses by 80-100%.[1][6] The program has placed over 650 dogs with farmers across Namibia and continues to expand.[6] CCF has since helped launch similar programs with sister organizations in South Africa, Botswana and Tanzania.[4] 2006 saw the creation of Future Farmers of Namibia, a program which educates and promotes sustainable farming cooperatives using an integrated system of non-lethal wildlife and ecosystem management.[1] A model farm on the CCF property houses more than 1,000 head of livestock (cows, goats and sheep) and serves to promote effective and safe animal husbandry practices, along with a creamery which showcases products from the model farm.[4] The Bushblok green energy technology project and the Biotechnology Demonstration Centre aim to bring ecological management and holistic solutions to the problems of thornbush encroachment and energy creation with sustainable land use, for local and expanding international parties.[5] CCF Namibia also houses the only cheetah genetics laboratory in Africa, the Life Technologies Conservation Genetics Laboratory, which holds the world's largest wild cheetah database of biological material samples, collected from over a thousand cheetahs.[6] There is also a fully functioning Veterinary Clinic on the premises.[3] On March 1, 2020, Marker"

Several other programs, their government liaison work, and the relationships and education that CCF has provided local farmers, land owners and stakeholders in cheetah hold-out areas has significantly reduced the killing of wild cheetahs.[1] Marker and the CCF team continues to educate, fundraise, develop holistic programs, and work with scientific bodies, governments and individuals around the world for the conservation of cheetahs in the wild.

The term Western Desert cultural bloc is often used by anthropologists and linguists when discussing the 40 or so Aboriginal groups that live there, who speak dialects of one language, often called the Western Desert language.[1] The term cultural bloc is used by anthropologists to describe culturally and linguistically similar groups (or nations) of Aboriginal peoples of Australia.[2][3] According to anthropologist Robert Tonkinson:[4] Extending over a million square miles, the Western Desert... covers a vast area of the interior of the continent. It extends across western South Australia into central and central northern Western Australia (south of the Kimberleys) and south-western Northern Territory, and it includes most of the hill country in northern South Australia..The area is marked by an overall similarity in both climatic conditions... and physiographical characteristics. More important, however, is its delineation as a distinct culture area.. its Aboriginal inhabitants share a common language (with dialectal variations), social organization, relationship to the natural environment, religion and mythology and aesthetic expression. The term Western Desert, then refers to both a cultural bloc and a geographical entity. The WDCB covers around 670,000\u00a0km2 (260,000\u00a0sq\u00a0mi) and extends across much of Western Australia, parts of South Australia, and parts of the Northern Territory.[5] includes the Gibson Desert, the Great Victoria Desert, the Great Sandy and Little Sandy Deserts in the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia. It stretches from the Nullarbor in the south to the Kimberley in the north, and from the Percival Lakes in the west through to the Pintupi lands in the Northern Territory.[citation needed] Ronald Berndt estimated that, before the European colonisation of Australia, the Western Desert peoples may have numbered as many as 10,000, but that by the late 1950s, their numbers were down to between 1,371 and 2,200.[6] Apart from the Canning Stock Route and the rabbit-proof fence, white contact with this part of Australia was very rare until the 1960s. Terry Long, a Native Patrol Officer employed by Weapons Research Establishment, observed:[7] No one had been out there. The desert, as far as the Department [WA Dept of Supply] was concerned... was an unknown, as it was to the whole of Western Australia. The Warburton Ranges [were] as far as anybody got. People in those days knew absolutely nothing about Aborigines. A 2007 court case held by the Federal Court of Australia to determine \"whether there was authorisation to apply for native title determination by all holders of native title claimed\" had to determine whether a Western Desert Cultural Bloc society existed before colonisation. The judgment held that such a society existed in 1829, and continues to exist today.[8] A 2018 native title determination determined that the Lappi Lappi and Ngulupi claimants \"belong to the Western Desert Cultural Bloc (WDCB) system of laws and customs\", and had rights to an area in the western part of the Tanami Desert.[9]",

Stefanco earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from the University of Colorado Boulder, a Master of Arts in women's history from Binghamton University, and a PhD in history from Duke University.[1][2][3] Stefanco worked as an assistant professor at Wheaton College. She then moved to California Polytechnic State University, where she became a tenured professor, chair of the history department, and director of the women's studies program. Stefanco then served as vice president for academic affairs at Agnes Scott College and as the founding dean of the College of Humanities and Social Sciences at California State University, Stanislaus.[4][better source needed] Stefanco was selected as the 11th President of the College of Saint Rose in April 2014 and took office on July 1, 2014.[5] During Stefanco's tenure, the college developed new degree programs, including cybersecurity, musical performance, and specialized computer science offerings. Amid budget cuts, Stefanco also reduced funding for several departments, and eliminated the philosophy, American studies, sociology, and economics programs. After several programs were eliminated, Stefanco faced a vote of no confidence in 2016, though she remained in her position.[6] That same year, the college was also censured by the American Association of University Professors.[7] On March 3, 2020, the college announced that Stefanco would step down as president of the College of Saint Rose effective June 30, 2020.[8] She was succeeded by interim president Marcia White. The College of Saint Rose closed at the end of the 2023-24 academic year, citing years of financial struggle.[9][10]"

The device acted not only as a memory card but was interactive itself via a small monochrome LCD display and buttons on its case. Many PlayStation games included software that could be downloaded and played on the PocketStation.  A release in Europe and North America was planned but was ultimately canceled. The PocketStation shares similarities with Sega's VMU for the Dreamcast. The PocketStation was released exclusively in Japan on January 23, 1999.[2][1] The original Japanese ship date for the PocketStation was set for December 23, 1998, but it was delayed a full month.[1] Sony only shipped an initial 60,000 units of the peripheral when it was released.[4] It was initially available in two case colors: white and clear.[5] It proved extremely popular, selling out all over the region. Sony planned to release the PocketStation outside Japan, engaging in promotional activity in Europe and North America, but the release did not occur.[6] SCEA cited an inability to meet Japanese demand as the reason for the PocketStation's absence.[7][8] Despite this, a few games, such as Final Fantasy VIII and SaGa Frontier 2, retained PocketStation functionality in their localized versions.[9][10] On November 5, 2013, it was announced that the PocketStation would be revived as an application for the PlayStation Vita, allowing users to play PocketStation format minigames for any classic PlayStation games that they own.[11] Originally only available to PlayStation Plus members, it was later released to the general public. It remains an exclusive to the Japanese PlayStation Vita. Categorized by Sony as a combination of a Memory Card and a miniature personal digital assistant, the device features a monochrome liquid crystal display (LCD), infrared communication capability, a real-time clock, built-in flash memory, and sound capability. To use the device's memory card functionality, it must be connected to a PlayStation through a memory card slot. Software for the PocketStation was typically distributed as extras for PlayStation games, included in the CD-ROM, enhancing the games with added features. Standalone software could also be downloaded through the PlayStation console onto a memory card, then transferred to the PocketStation for use.[14] A built-in infrared data interface allows direct transfer of data such as game saves between PocketStation units, as well as multiplayer gaming.[14] The PocketStation's most popular game was Doko Demo Issyo, which sold over 1.5 million copies in Japan and is the first game to star Sony's mascot Toro.[16] The PocketStation was discontinued in July 2002 after having shipped nearly five million units.[17]",

It functioned as a revenue-generating media outlet with a \"G\" rating (general audiences or general interest station) and without editorial or content restrictions. It was launched two and a half months following the launch of RTV Pink. Prior to its license revocation in late April 2006 and subsequent folding during March 2007, BKTV had significant viewership all over Serbia. According to Nielsen Research data for the calendar year 2005 (its last full year of regular terrestrial broadcasting), BKTV held 11.2% of the Serbian TV audience with a daily average of 3.2\u00a0million people tuning into its programmes, which meant it was the third most watched TV network in Serbia at the time behind Pink (22.5% market share and 3.7\u00a0million daily viewers on average) and RTS 1 (Serbian TV channel) (22.4% market share and 3.9\u00a0million daily viewers on average).[1] BK was well ahead of fourth placed B92 (6.8%) and fifth placed RTS 2 (6.3%). The station's most watched programme ever was the live broadcast of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107's funeral on 18 March 2006 when 2,688,622\nviewers (25.2% of the Serbian television market) tuned into BK.[2] The company started broadcasting a TV signal on 5 December 1994. As of April 2004, BKTV covered more than 90% of the territory and reached about 90% of the entire population. It aired the Serbian versions of the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? quiz (\u017delite li da postanete milioner?), The Weakest Link (Najslabija karika), as well as two seasons of the local Idol series \u2013 Idol. Additionally, during the 2000s, the network started producing its own comedy, drama, and soap-opera content such as Crni Gruja (historical comedy), and Jelena (soap). Telefakt, BKTV's main news programme was shown several times a day, while a shorter news bulletin programme Naslovi ran every hour on the hour. BKTV's morning show was named Budilnik. BKTV also bought rights for 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany, but had to forfeit them because a month before the competition was to start, the station's licence got revoked. The rights were then bought out by public broadcaster RTS. RTV BK Telecom was on the cusp of new technologies. It was the first TV station in Serbia to start broadcasting on the internet by making selected news programmes available for download and streaming on their website. It eventually introduced the BK Player, a media player designed to play BK TV program live on the Internet 24 hours a day. The latest version was BK Player 2. On 11 October 2017, a channel named BK (using the same 1994 logo) launched on a cable operator. However, this channel broadcasts some of archived content the original channel has aired. This channel later shut down on 1 October 2020, after the channel failed to gain an allocated broadcasting frequency in late November the previous year. On 25 April 2006, the Serbian state agency for airwaves control (Republi\u010dka radiodifuzna agencija) decided to revoke BKTV's broadcasting license for 30 days. The reason given was \"violation of broadcasting regulations\". Shortly after midnight on 26 April, BKTV's physical location was raided by the police and the station ceased broadcasts. Around 11 a.m. the same day, most of the cable operators stopped carrying the station. It nevertheless continued to broadcast via satellite, and television sets have been set out televising the channel in Knez Mihailova Street in Belgrade for passers-by to watch. May 2006 allocations of broadcasting frequencies by the Republican Broadcasting Agency's (RBA) of Serbia sparked a national controversy, and many called foul play. RBA did not award a frequency to several companies, including RTV BK Telecom. The company's bank accounts were blocked and BKTV had been taken off the air terrestrially. BKTV commenced transmission over satellite with stripped down programming consisting mostly of SMS messages and music videos. Throughout 2006, most of BKTV's staff and on-air personalities left. The station eventually folded for good on 9 March 2007 at 7\u00a0pm. On 5 December 2011, date picked symbolically as the 17th anniversary of the station's establishment, BK television partially returned by starting to broadcast over the Internet via a YouTube channel named BKTVnews.

This book\u2014which, as pointed out by Anne-\u00c9lisabeth Moutet\u00a0[fr], was edited by Gallimard[12]\u2014 is an autobiographical narrative which content, according to Jean Pache, appears to be \"strange and meaningful\".[4] The common thread unfolds over \"her history, her childhood, the discovery of her cerebral sexuality, her experience as a dominatrix, in a style as precise as lively and literary\".[13] The script is prefaced by Pierre Bourgeade, who considered the literary quintessentiality of this essay as part of the expression of an \"unconscious freedom of its own\",[14] while Jean-Jacques Pauvert displayed it as a \"major work of erotic literature over the past ten years\".[15] In this autobiography, the author presented herself in two ways: Fran\u00e7oise, the dominatrix, and Marianne, \"who discovered her masochism by watching the whip scenes in pirate movies as a teenager\".[13][16] Anne Larue\u00a0[fr] emphasized on the link which appeared to prevail between those two paradoxical idiosyncrasies: \"Fran\u00e7oise, it is first of all the name of a little girl of twelve years old [...] who plays the mistress\".[16] The book introduced sadomasochism into mainstream literature, \"without censorship, but also without complacency towards the reader\",[11] by focusing on the \"breaks\" that lead to it,[17] from an angle that, according to Annick Foucault, gains the consent from partners.[18] Annick Foucault suggested that they be recognized as being endowed with \"some weakness\" and, further on, she commented the aforesaid point as follows: Should this weakness be dramatized or simulated, what would be the concern? They come out strengthened  while trading their cumbersome chains for a three-piece suit, then they return home feeling both soothed and comforted.[19][20] She pleads for the abandonment of some biases: By eroticizing barbarism, fetishists and sadomasochists castrate the true executioners through their own weapons.[21][22] Her intellection echoes the philosophical thought of Gilles Deleuze, to whom she pays tribute,[23] in a way that, according to Charles J. Stivale, conveys a \"perceptive and fascinating reflection on La V\u00e9nus \u00e0 la fourrure, Pr\u00e9sentation de Sacher-Masoch de Deleuze\".[24] According to C\u00e9line du Ch\u00e9n\u00e9, Mistress Fran\u00e7oise turns out to be \"probably the most intellectual of the dominatrixes of the Parisian scene\", owning \"all the editions\" of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch and \"having maintained a correspondence\" with Gilles Deleuze,[13] who, as per Jean Pache, would have sealed \"this unexpected disciple friendship and consideration\".[4] After the publication of her story, which, as duly noted by Giovanni Firmian, was \"a great success in France\",[25] she was invited to various French talk shows[5][7][26] and gave interviews about sadomasochism.[27][28] On the occasion of the release of a translation of her book in Italy,[29] Giovanni Firmian described her author as \"the queen of dominatrixes and sadomasochistic practices, the most famous one in France, but also known throughout the rest of Europe and United States\".[25][11] However, the Italian periodical La Stampa reveals significantly more critical comments recorded by the journalist Mirella Serri, who believes that the author of Ma\u00eetresse Fran\u00e7oise considers herself to be the embodiment of \"an outstanding artist belonging to a scarce and special breed: i.e. the \"mystics\" of sex\".[8]",

        "text": "Hambuch is an Ortsgemeinde \u2013 a municipality belonging to a Verbandsgemeinde, a kind of collective municipality \u2013 in the Cochem-Zell district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It belongs to the Verbandsgemeinde of Kaisersesch, whose seat is in the like-named town. The municipality lies in the Eifel, on the Autobahn A\u00a048.[3] Hambuch's long history makes it one of the oldest settlements in the area. It had its first documentary mention as early as 866 when Abbot Ansbald of Pr\u00fcm documented the donation of an estate in the village named Haganbahc in the Mayengau (the country around Mayen) by his monastery to the dowager Higilda. The donation, however, apparently did not include the village church. The mention of a church does, however, imply that the village was founded quite some time before 866, but there is no documentary evidence dating from before Abbot Ansbald's record. The name \u201cHambuch\u201d itself could have the following origins. The root word hag refers to an enclosed piece of land, which could be of any size, ringed with pollarded shrubs. Used for this would have been thorny shrubs such as hawthorn or dog rose, or thickly growing plants such as hornbeam, a sprig of which appears as a charge in the municipality's coat of arms. The \u2014anbach ending might simply refer to the village's location near the brook (Bach in German) known as the Pommerbach. The name changed often throughout time. Another spelling was to be seen in 893 in Pr\u00fcm Abbey\u2019s official directory of holdings, the Pr\u00fcmer Urbar. In 1222, Abbot Caesarius noted that the Count of Are had a valuable estate on the Mayfeld called Haynbahc. In the 12th century, the village was listed in the Carden Foundation\u2019s directory of holdings under the name Hagenbach. In 1395, a document from Archbishop of Trier Werner records that he enfeoffed \u201cJohann, the Lord at Daun\u201d with a share of the court at Haenbach. Other name variants recorded over time have been Hambach, Heimbach and Harnbach. In the Middle Ages, the lordship over the village was held jointly, with half in Electoral-Trier hands and the other half shared between the Electorate of Cologne and the Counts of Leyen. The border between the two archbishoprics ran straight through the village. The two streets, Eulgemer Stra\u00dfe and Brunnenstra\u00dfe, are even today perceived as a boundary of sorts, setting apart the Hinnew\u00e4ldtje and the Ewwew\u00e4ldtje, the local names for the lower and upper village respectively. Beginning in 1794, Hambuch lay under French rule. In 1814 it was assigned to the Kingdom of Prussia at the Congress of Vienna. Since 1947, it has been part of the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.[4] In 2005 the project Dorfakademie Hambuch, which had set itself the goal of \u201cmaking life in the rural area even more attractive\u201d,[5] won first place in Rhineland-Palatinate's second volunteer contest, in which outstanding community projects earn recognition.[6][7] The council is made up of 12 council members, who were elected by majority vote at the municipal election held on 7 June 2009, and the honorary mayor as chairman.[8] Hambuch's mayor is Matthias Hetger.[1] The municipality's arms might be described thus: Vert an abbot's staff with sudarium and ensigned with a cross bottonn\u00e9e bendwise Or between, in sinister chief, a hornbeam twig couped and leafed of three and, in dexter base, an urn, both argent.

        "text": "Archibald James Edward Douglas, 1st Baron Douglas (10 July 1748 \u2013 26 December 1827), was a Scottish politician. He was born Archibald James Edward Stewart, in Paris,[1] the twin son of Sir John Stewart, 3rd Baronet (1687\u20131764) and Lady Jane Douglas, daughter of James Douglas, 2nd Marquess of Douglas.[2] The circumstances of the birth were controversial. His mother was the sister of the wealthy Duke of Douglas. As the Duke was childless, his estate would pass to the next in line, the Duke of Hamilton, unless an heir could be found. Lady Jane was 47 when she married the 60-year-old Colonel John Stewart, a man described by her brother, the Duke of Douglas, as a 'wore-out old rake'. In the summer of 1748, by which time she was 50, Lady Jane gave birth to twin boys - Archibald and Sholto - at the house of Madame Le Brun in Faubourg Saint-Germain, Paris. There followed a series of court cases, which became known as the Douglas Cause or Douglas Case. In 1767 Archibald lost a much publicised court case concerning the rights to the Douglas estates. His opponents, the 12-year-old Duke of Hamilton, Hew Dalrymple, and others, claimed that Stewart was not the son of Lady Jane Douglas, and thus was not the rightful heir to the Douglas estates. In February 1769 the House of Lords reversed the decision. Central to the case was whether Lady Jane was still able to have children and at the trials, intimate evidence of her menstrual status was presented by servants.  However, witnesses were produced by the Hamiltons who claimed to have noticed nothing about Lady Jane's appearance to indicate that she was pregnant. Hamilton lawyers also found two French couples who both said they had sold babies to a mysterious foreign couple about the time the 'twins' were born. Douglas lawyers countered by providing evidence of a male midwife said to have delivered Lady Jane's babies. Archibald Douglas was able to inherit and his descendants, who included British Minister Alec Douglas-Home and has family, have benefited ever since. Douglas was MP for Forfarshire from 1782 to 1790 and Lord Lieutenant of Forfarshire from 1794 to 1827. In parliament he was a loyal follower of Henry Dundas and William Pitt, and hoped to be rewarded with a peerage. Although he would have preferred an earldom, he was created Baron Douglas, of Douglas in the County of Lanark, in 1790. Lord Douglas was an improving landlord who continued the rebuilding of Douglas Castle begun by his uncle. However the 1772 collapse of the Ayr bank of Douglas, Heron & Company was a blow to his financial position. In 1795, he raised the Angusshire Regiment of Fencible Infantry, who served in Ireland[3] and Dumfries, as well as being involved with founding the Angus Volunteers Company of Fencible Men earlier in the same year. It was the latter Company that were on duty at the funeral of Robert Burns in 1796 according to officials in the Douglas History Archive [1][permanent dead link] although some references have inaccurately attributed this to the former group.[4] As Lord-Lieutenant of Forfarshire, he was appointed Colonel of the Forfarshire Militia when that was raised in 1798, with the Brevet rank of Colonel in the army while that regiment was embodied.[5] His son the Hon Archibald Douglas took over the command in 1802.[6] Lord Douglas married twice and had nine children, five sons and four daughters, most of whom reached old age. His first marriage was in 1771 to Lady Lucy Graham (1751\u20131780), a daughter of the 2nd Duke of Montrose. Before her death in 1780, they were the parents of:[7] In 1783, he married secondly to Lady Frances Scott (1750\u20131817), sister of the 3rd Duke of Buccleuch.[9] Together, they were the parents of: Douglas died on 26 December 1827 at Bothwell Castle, Lanarkshire. He was buried in Douglas parish church in the same county. He was succeeded by three of his sons in turn: Archibald, Charles, and the Rev. James Douglas on whose death, the Barony of Douglas of Douglas became extinct. His daughter, Jane Margaret Douglas became his eventual heir. She married Henry, 2nd Baron Montagu of Boughton and had a daughter, Lucy Elizabeth Scott-Montagu-Douglas (later Countess of Home) to whom the Douglas estates descended.",

        "title": "The Frond Files",
        "text": "\"The Frond Files\" is the 12th episode of the fourth season of the American animated comedy series Bob's Burgers. Written by Lizzie and Wendy Molyneux, the episode sees Bob (H. Jon Benjamin) and Linda Belcher (John Roberts) visiting a Wagstaff School exhibition entitled \"Why I Love Wagstaff.\" Noticing that their children's reports are missing from the exhibition, they confront school guidance counselor Phillip Frond (David Herman), who gives them the discarded reports to read for themselves. The episode is divided into three segments corresponding to each Belcher child's report: Louise's (Kristen Schaal), a Terminator-inspired science fiction story; Gene's (Eugene Mirman), a musical act parodying Rock 'n' Roll High School; and Tina's (Dan Mintz), a piece of zombie \"friend fiction\" which pays homage to Night of the Living Dead. All three stories portray Mr. Frond as an antagonistic character, and he removed them from the exhibition because they were \"offensive\" and Frond is already in trouble with the school superintendent because his credentials aren't valid in the state. Comedian Aziz Ansari guest stars in \"The Frond Files,\" voicing recurring character Darryl in the episode's first and third segment. It originally aired on Fox on March 9, 2014, drawing an audience of 2.21 million viewers. \"The Frond Files\" received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its humor and pop culture references, and was later cited by Bob's Burgers creator Loren Bouchard as one of his favorite episodes of the series. Bob and Linda are at Wagstaff School for an exhibition themed \"Why I Love Wagstaff,\" only to find that their children's reports are nowhere to be seen. They find Mr. Frond, who after unsuccessfully trying to hide from them relents and takes them to his office. Frond explains that he pulled the projects from the exhibition due to their offensiveness, as well as to prevent any further issues with the superintendent, with whom he is already in conflict due to his credentials being invalid in the state. Nonetheless, he allows Bob and Linda to read the reports themselves. Louise's report begins with the arrival of a robot from the future resembling Mr. Frond, built by the real Frond and sent back in time to eliminate Louise. As Louise flees, she is spotted by an older version of Darryl, who traveled back in time after uncovering Frond's plot. He reveals that the robot was built in retaliation for a prank which Louise will pull off on the day of her eighth-grade graduation ceremony: placing a brownie on Frond's chair, which he sat on thus making him appear to have soiled his pants, which drove him to quit his job from the embarrassment. While pleased with this revelation, Louise chastises Darryl for not bringing back any useful equipment to stop the robot and providing nothing more than a \"bucket load of exposition and a stupid mustache.\" Louise and Darryl meet up with Gene and Tina as the chase continues and the four are soon cornered in the cafeteria kitchen, where Louise tricks the Frond robot into jumping into a vat of boiling creamed corn that dissolves it. They celebrate, only to discover more Frond robots, all brandishing the clothes of various supporting characters from the series. The scene cuts to the Belcher siblings sitting at a picnic table in a beach in Mexico (or Belize, as Gene claims), where they have been forced into hiding, as Louise finishes writing her journal. Gene's report re-imagines Wagstaff School as the Fart School for the Gifted, where Gene and his fellow students sing and dance to his original songs about farts. Mr. Frond, however, confiscates his keyboard just as he is about to play his most impressive fart sound effect yet. With the help of his siblings, Gene is able to distract Frond and reclaim the keyboard from \"Keyboard Jail.\" Afterwards, he plays a song about farts over the PA system, which ends with a fart so powerful that it ends up destroying the school. Tina's report is her usual erotic \"friend fiction.\" As she carries out her duties as a hall monitor, busting Tammy for sneaking off-campus and then being tricked into letting her go, Tina talks to members of the basketball team, who will be receiving jock itch vaccinations. She later finds the nurse's office in ruins, and at a pep rally the basketball team re-emerges as zombies. Tina, Gene, Louise, Darryl, Jimmy, Jr. (Benjamin), and Zeke (Bobby Tisdale) escape and try to take refuge in the teacher's lounge\u2014the only room in the school with a lock\u2014only to find that Mr. Frond has locked himself in and is unwilling to let them in, as he needs to survive to rally the survivors. As he explains his cowardice, a zombified nurse emerges from behind and bites him. The horde catches up to them, but Tina discovers her ability to charm the zombies by doing hair flips and awkward erotic dancing; the zombies stop and become her collective boyfriends. Bob and Linda find that their children's stories are very creative, with Gene's even bringing Linda to tears. Frond then breaks down and reveals that the real reason he refused to display the reports was because all three portray him as a villain. Bob and Linda try to console him and give advice about relating to children, and a rejuvenated Frond decides to deliver a speech to the superintendent, though still refusing to display the reports. He stands up, not noticing that he has been sitting on a brownie the entire time. Bob and Linda keep silent and take Gene's confiscated keyboard as they leave. At the Belcher residence, Louise gets a subconscious feeling that her prank has taken effect. \"The Frond Files\" was written by Lizzie and Wendy Molyneux and directed by Jennifer Coyle.[1] In an interview with Rolling Stone, Bob's Burgers creator Loren Bouchard cited \"The Frond Files\" as one of his favorite episodes of the series and stated: \"Again, the fantasy life of the kids\u2014being inside their heads for so long is really fun for us.\"[2] Bouchard revealed that producing Gene's musical number in the episode's second segment \"was such a fun indulgence\" for the Bob's Burgers crew.[2] Comedian Aziz Ansari guest stars in \"The Frond Files,\" reprising his role as the recurring character Darryl; the episode's first segment depicts an older version of the character who travels back in time to present-day Wagstaff School.[1] Ansari first revealed his appearance in a Reddit \"Ask Me Anything\" thread, where he stated that the episode was a \"great idea\" and that \"anyone [who] is a fan of Terminator 2 is going to be VERY  [sic] pleased.\"[3] On March 7, 2014, two previews of the episode were uploaded to YouTube: a clip from \"Fart School for the Gifted\" on the Animation Domination channel,[4] and a behind-the-scenes animatic on the Behind Bob's Burgers channel.[5] An official poster for \"The Frond Files,\" designed by Hector Reynoso and Anthony Aguinaldo, was later posted on the official Bob's Burgers writers' blog on March 9, coinciding with the episode's airing,[6] followed by an extended music video of Gene's fart song on March 18.[7] The episode was dedicated to the memory of Oliver Miles Cross, writers Lizzie and Wendy Molyneux's nephew. Cross died in 2013 from leukemia at the age of 5. Wendy went on to channel a fundraiser to raise funds for CureSearch in his honor.[8] Louise's segment, \"Why I Love Wagstaff,\" is a science fiction story that bases major elements of its plot, including the arrival of a robot from the future, on the Terminator film series\u2014in particular the second installment, Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).[9][10] A scene in the segment where the central characters take refuge in a kitchen references a similar scene from the 1993 film Jurassic Park.[10][11] Gene's segment, \"Fart School for the Gifted,\" spoofs the 1979 musical comedy film Rock 'n' Roll High School and plays on the \"adults v. kids theme of '80s films.\"[9]  Also Mr. Frond's appearance is based on Principal Togar, also from Rock and Roll High School. Tina's segment, \"A Tale of Horror,\" is a homage to the 1968 zombie horror film Night of the Living Dead, and as such is animated in black-and-white.[10] \"The Frond Files\" first aired in the United States on March 9, 2014 on Fox, as a part of the Animation Domination programming block.[12] It marked the series' return after a two-month hiatus, along with its debut at new earlier 7:00 time slot to make way for airings of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.[9][13] The episode was watched by 2.21 million viewers and received a 0.9/3 Nielsen rating in the 18\u201349 demographic, becoming the fourth most-watched program of the Animation Domination block for the night.[14] Pilot Viruet of The A.V. Club gave \"The Frond Files\" a grade of B+, writing that the episode was \"incredibly funny and reminded [her] of why the Belchers are [her] favorite family currently on television.\"[11] However, she felt that the episode \"didn't quickly become a favorite the way that many Bob's Burgers episodes do\" and was unsure of whether she \"dug the vignette format,\" adding: \"Much of it, as funny as it was, seemed like a retreading of things that we already knew.\"[11] Nonetheless, Viruet was positive towards its \"one-liners and quick jokes\" and stated that \"every character\u2014and every voice actor\u2014was on point.\"[11] Giving the episode an 8.9 out of 10, Robert Ham of Paste cited \"The Frond Files\" as \"one of the finest and funniest [episodes] of an already great fourth season.\"[9] Ham wrote: \"The whole thing is one ridiculous and brilliant pop culture reference and bit of silliness after the other. Yet, it again emphasizes the deep bond that the family has.\"[9] Matt Brassil of Heave Media praised the Terminator and Jurassic Park references in Louise's act of the episode, and while noting that Gene's story \"falls a little flat to lower your expectations,\" described Tina's \"zombie love story\" as \"easily the funniest act...loose on plot but high on substance.\"[10]",

Cross died in 2013 from leukemia at the age of 5. Wendy went on to channel a fundraiser to raise funds for CureSearch in his honor.[8] Louise's segment, \"Why I Love Wagstaff,\" is a science fiction story that bases major elements of its plot, including the arrival of a robot from the future, on the Terminator film series\u2014in particular the second installment, Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991).[9][10] A scene in the segment where the central characters take refuge in a kitchen references a similar scene from the 1993 film Jurassic Park.[10][11] Gene's segment, \"Fart School for the Gifted,\" spoofs the 1979 musical"

Tina's segment, \"A Tale of Horror,\" is a homage to the 1968 zombie horror film Night of the Living Dead, and as such is animated in black-and-white.[10] \"The Frond Files\" first aired in the United States on March 9, 2014 on Fox, as a part of the Animation Domination programming block.[12] It marked the series' return after a two-month hiatus, along with its debut at new earlier 7:00 time slot to make way for airings of Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey.[9][13] The episode was watched by 2.21 million viewers and received a 0.9/3 Nielsen rating in the 18\u201349 demographic, becoming the fourth most-watched program of the Animation Domination block for the night.[14] Pilot Viruet of The A.V. Club gave \"The Frond Files\" a grade of B+, writing that the episode was \"incredibly funny and reminded [her] of why the Belchers are [her] favorite family currently on television.\"[11] However, she felt that the episode \"didn't quickly become a favorite the way that many Bob's Burgers episodes do\" and was unsure of whether she \"dug the vignette format,\" adding: \"Much of it, as funny as it was, seemed like a retreading of things that we already knew.\"[11] Nonetheless, Viruet was positive towards its \"one-liners and quick jokes\" and stated that \"every character\u2014and every voice actor\u2014was on point.\"[11] Giving the"

Yet, it again emphasizes the deep bond that the family has.\"[9] Matt Brassil of Heave Media praised the Terminator and Jurassic Park references in Louise's act of the episode, and while noting that Gene's story \"falls a little flat to lower your expectations,\" described Tina's \"zombie love story\" as \"easily the funniest act...loose on plot but high on substance.\"[10]"

        "text": "NJ Transit Rail Operations provides passenger service on 12 lines at a total of 165 stations, some operated in conjunction with Amtrak and Metro-North Railroad.[1] NJ Transit Rail Operations was established by NJ Transit to run commuter rail operations in New Jersey. In January 1983 it took over operation from Conrail, which itself had been formed in 1976 through the merger of a number of financially troubled railroads and had been operating commuter railroad service under contract from the New Jersey Department of Transportation. Soon after its creation, NJT commissioned a survey of operating stations, 53 of which were eventually nominated and listed on the state and federal registers of historic places in 1984. Since 2009, NJ Transit is a stakeholder in the state's \"smart growth\" transit-oriented development initiatives, its transit hubs forming the basis for transit villages.[2] The regional rail network, which serves the northern and central parts of New Jersey and Rockland and Orange counties in New York, radiates from Hoboken Terminal in Hoboken, New York Penn Station and Newark Penn Station. Lines intersect at Secaucus Junction.[3][4] Service from Atlantic City to Philadelphia is provided by one line separate from the rest of the NJ Transit system, though SEPTA Regional Rail service connects Philadelphia and Trenton.[3][4][5] Amtrak provides service in New Jersey along the Northeast Corridor between Newark and Trenton and at intermediate points.[3] Since its inception, NJ Transit has closed several stations and opened new ones reflecting infrastructure improvements and discontinuance or additions in service. Some station locations, not listed here, became part of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail and the River Line, both of which were largely built along existing railroad rights-of-way. New and re-opened stations are being built or proposed along planned expansions and extensions, notably the Lackawanna Cut-Off, which is under reconstruction. Restoration of passenger service along the West Trenton Line, Monmouth-Ocean-Middlesex project right-of-ways, and the Raritan Valley/Lehigh Line, which include the reactivation/construction of new stations, have all been considered but not advanced. Waldwick (weekends, limited weekdays)Port Jervis (limited service) New York Penn Station (limited weekdays) Summit (weekends) Bernardsville (limited weekdays) Ridgewood, Waldwick (limited service) Hoboken Terminal Denville, Dover, Lake Hopatcong, Mount Olive, or Hackettstown (limited weekdays) Bay Street (weekends) Hoboken Terminal (limited weekdays) Summit (weekdays) Lake Hopatcong or Hackettstown (limited weekdays) Newark Penn Station (one inbound trip) Jersey Avenue (weekdays) Long Branch (Bay Head diesel shuttle) South Amboy (limited weekdays)Rahway (limited weekends) New Bridge Landing (two weekday trips) Hoboken Terminal (one inbound weekday trip) In 1981, NJ Transit commissioned the State Historic Preservation Office to conduct a study of 112 train stations under its jurisdiction built before World War II that were still in operation. Many of thematic nomination stations are listed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places (ID#5080) on March 17, 1984.[16] The SHPO recommended that fifty-three stations, some of which had already been listed, be included in a thematic nomination for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Forty stations were added on June 22, 1984 and the remainder added on September 29, 1984. (#64000496)[15] Most were along former lines and heritage railroads that had become part of NJ Transit, while West Trenton is used by SEPTA. The oldest station building, built in 1868 at the Ramsey-Main Street station, was not listed. The oldest active station to be listed on NRHP was Hackensack's 1869-built Anderson Street station, until it was destroyed in a fire and explosion in 2009, and thus was delisted. Proposals to revive service on the West Trenton Line and Lackawanna Cut-Off include the re-use of some listed stations in both New Jersey and northeastern Pennsylvania. Two significant individually-listed historic stations include Newark Penn Station and Hoboken Terminal, both of which are major stations that also serve as terminals for light rail, PATH subway trains, and in the case of Hoboken, ferries across the Hudson River to Pier 11 at Wall Street and the Battery Park City Ferry Terminal. The New Jersey Department of Transportation established the Transit Village Initiative in 1999 to promote transit-oriented development (TOD),[17] offering multi-agency assistance and grants to municipalities for projects which fulfill certain conditions to promote higher density development and use of public transportation within a 1 mile (1.6\u00a0km) radius of a transit hub,  specifying appropriate mixed land-use strategy, available property, station-area management, and commitment to affordable housing, job growth/maintenance, and cultural activities. Transit village development must also preserve the architectural integrity of historically significant buildings and the landscape. As of 2015[update], the state had made 30 transit village designations, many of which are centered around \"Main Street\" or central business district train stations.[18] Since 2008, there has been significant population growth and increased ridership in neighborhoods around stations.[19] Metro-North Railroad's West-of-Hudson service is operated by NJ Transit. NJ Transit owns the Pascack Valley Line right-of-way and stations, which are leased to Metro-North. On the Port Jervis Line north of Suffern, Metro-North owns or leases the ROW under an agreement with Norfolk Southern Railway and operates the stations.[3] Two SEPTA Regional Rail lines terminate at stations in New Jersey, one of which is not served NJ Transit. NJ Transit and Metro-North Railroad also operated a joint Train to the Game service for football games at the Meadowlands Sports Complex with stops at New Haven, West Haven, Bridgeport, Fairfield, Fairfield Metro, Westport, South Norwalk, Darien, Stamford, Greenwich, Rye, and Larchmont on the New Haven Line. Between 2008 and 2016, New Jersey Transit added four infill stations on existing lines. As of August 2020[update], one additional infill station is planned. Several other lines are proposed for restoration. Parts of the Lackawanna Cut-Off Restoration Project in New Jersey have been implemented and there are proposals to extend the line west and into northeastern Pennsylvania. Restoration of service along the West Trenton Line between West Trenton (with connecting service to SEPTA's West Trenton Line) and Bridgewater where it would junction with the Raritan Valley Line (RVL) has been proposed, but not advanced.[109] Extension of the Raritan Valley Line in connection with the Lehigh Line into Lehigh County, Pennsylvania has also been considered.[110][111][112] NJ Transit has closed numerous stations since its inception due to realignments in service or low ridership.",

        "text": "The AutoPulse is an automated, portable, battery-powered cardiopulmonary resuscitation device created by Revivant and subsequently purchased and currently manufactured by ZOLL Medical Corporation. It is a chest compression device composed of a constricting band and half backboard that is intended to be used as an adjunct to CPR during advanced cardiac life support by professional health care providers. The AutoPulse uses a distributing band to deliver the chest compressions. In literature it is also known as LDB-CPR (Load Distributing Band-CPR). The AutoPulse measures chest size and resistance before it delivers the unique combination of thoracic and cardiac chest compressions. The compression depth and force varies per patient.  The chest displacement equals a 20% reduction in the anterior-posterior chest depth. The physiological duty cycle is 50%, and it runs in a 30:2, 15:2 or continuous compression mode, which is user-selectable, at a rate of 80 compressions-per-minute. The patient's head, shoulders and upper back lay upon the base unit, with the controls for the AutoPulse beside the patient's left ear.  It can be augmented for cervical spinal support.  The unit contains the control computer, the rechargeable battery, and the motors that operate the LifeBand.  The LifeBand is an adjustable strap that covers the entire rib cage.  When the patient is strapped in and the start button is pressed, the LifeBand pulls tight around the chest, determines the patient's chest size and resistance, and proceeds to rhythmically constrict the entire rib cage, pumping the heart at a rate of 80 compressions per minute.  The LifeBand can be placed over defibrillation pads.[1] The LifeBand is disposable, and designed to be used on a single patient for sanitary reasons.[citation needed] The load-distributing band system, employing thoracic compressions, produces higher blood flow compared to CPR consisting of sternal compressions only. The potential to produce blood flow for a sudden cardiac arrest victim is in large part determined by the peak power of the compression. Factors determining the power of the compression are the force of the compression, the depth of the compression, and the duration that the compression is held at maximum depth.[citation needed] The gold standard for resuscitation research is survival to hospital discharge. Although it may seem valuable to measure short-term and intermediate outcomes like return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or survival to hospital admission, anything less than neurologically intact survival and hospital discharge is ultimately irrelevant.[2] Several animal studies have shown that automated CPR machines are more effective at providing circulatory support than manual CPR. One study showed that use of the AutoPulse produced blood flow to the heart and brain that was comparable to pre-arrest levels.[3] In another study, an adapted AutoPulse was shown to be highly effective in support of cardiac arrest in animals, whereas manual CPR was tenuous in its effectiveness. Pigs were used in the study, and were left in cardiac arrest for eight minutes to simulate average ambulance response time. 73% of the pigs that were put into the AutoPulse were revived, and 88% of the surviving pigs showed no neurological damage. None of the pigs that received manual CPR survived.[4] The Circulation Improving Resuscitation Care (CIRC) trial is the largest prospective randomized trial to date for mechanical chest compressions in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The goal was to demonstrate that the AutoPulse Non-invasive Cardiac Support Pump is a safe and effective component of a system of care focusing on high-quality chest compressions.[citation needed]\nCompared to high-quality manual CPR, AutoPulse CPR resulted in statistically equivalent survival to hospital discharge and no difference in neurologic status at discharge in adults with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest of presumed cardiac etiology.[5] There are times when delivering high quality manual CPR isn't practical or even possible; the results of the CIRC trial confirm the important role the AutoPulse system can play in improving resuscitation outcomes.[citation needed] In 2005, American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation gave load-distributing band CPR (LDB-CPR) a Class IIb recommendation.[6] As of 2025, the American Heart Association recommends against the routine use of mechanical CPR devices, such as the AutoPulse.[7] The AutoPulse has received a fair amount of criticism surrounding its battery life, bulk, and studies suggesting poor survival to hospital discharge. The most notable case of such issues can be found in the news reports of the resuscitation of Prince Friso after he and his companion were caught in an avalanche. In that case, the AutoPulse batteries failed after only 9 and 15 minutes.[8] Studies have also failed to show an increase in survival to hospital discharge. During the ASPIRE trial (the first multi-centered, randomized trial with large enrollment), the survival to hospital discharge rates decreased from 9.9% with manual CPR to approximately 5%. Because of these findings, the ethics review board terminated the study. However, some researchers question the validity of the ASPIRE protocol.[9] The CIRC study results additionally indicate that the AutoPulse increases the time before first defibrillation and decrease the average compressions per minute in comparison with manual CPR. Overall, the study shows no improvement over high quality manual CPR.[10] Several cases have been reported where the AutoPulse has caused additional injury to patients receiving compressions from the device.[11][12]",

        "title": "TV TEM Bauru",
        "text": "TV TEM Bauru (channel 26) is a Brazilian television station based in Bauru, a city in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, affiliated with TV Globo. It is owned-and-operated by Traffic Group as of 2003 under the TV TEM banner, which also owns three other stations under said name in the inland of S\u00e3o Paulo, and covers approximately 95 municipalities.[1][2] Its studios are located in the Jardim Bela Vista neighborhood, and its transmission antenna is in the Jardim Ouro Verde neighborhood. In the 1950s, Italian-Brazilian businessman Jo\u00e3o Simonetti, founder of R\u00e1dio Clube Bauru, Bauru's first radio station, decided to establish the city's first television station. Still during the Get\u00falio Vargas government, Simonetti asked the president to grant him a television channel, which was granted to him only at the end of the decade, in 1959. He also invested around Cr$7.5 million in necessary equipment for the creation of the station, and also signed a contract with M\u00e1rio Wallace Simonsen's REBRATEL, enabling the possibility to install 1000 television sets in the city. Still in 1959, viewers were able to see TV Bauru operating on an experimental basis on VHF channel 2.[3] On August 1, 1960, TV Bauru was officially founded as the first television station in the interior of S\u00e3o Paulo and also in a Brazilian state (existing stations until then had only been founded in capital cities). The station was responsible for producing several variety programs, musical shows, the news program Nosso Jornal, and even a local telenovela that was written and also starred by Clorinda Resta. Several professionals from the city's radio stations also migrated to the new means of communication.[3][4] However, the difficulties in maintaining a high-profile television station were enormous. There were few advertisers for the channel, and with money missing from the till, many employees received payments after the due date.[5] All these factors led Simonetti to sell the station to Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es Victor Costa in October of the same year. With the purchase, there was also a considerable increase in the programming range, with the addition of North American slots and programs relayed from TV Paulista, which was also owned by OVC.[3] In May 1965, Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es Victor Costa were sold to Roberto Marinho, who incorporated his outlets into Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es Globo. With this, TV Bauru became an owned-and-operated station of Rede Globo, together with TV Paulista, which in 1967 was renamed TV Globo S\u00e3o Paulo. Under the direction of Arceno Athas, local productions are gradually being phased out, and only journalism is being prioritized. The programs Globo Interior and Globo Agora \u00e0 Noite stood out at that time, which were produced and also presented by journalists such as Roberto Purini, Edson Fagnani, Jo\u00e3o Dias Antunes and Fred Calmon. However, these programs were gradually replaced by Jornal Nacional, broadcast via satellite. In 1971, with the emergence of Jornal Hoje, the station created a local version of the newscast presented by Alonso Padilha, however, this was gradually replaced by the S\u00e3o Paulo version presented by Mar\u00edlia Gabriela. The station reached the end of the 1970s with only a reporting team made up of reporter Jair Acetuno, cameramen Moacir Mendon\u00e7a and Walcir Coelho, and lighting designer Carlos Corrente, who together only produced reports shown during Jornal das Sete, produced in S\u00e3o Paulo.[4] On February 28, 1980, the station started showing a 2-minute local block of JS, which on January 3, 1983, was replaced by SPTV.[3] The outlook remained the same until 1984, when the Central Globo de Affiliadas e Expans\u00e3o emerged to improve and revitalize all the journalism of Globo's owned-and-operated stations and affiliates. In the meantime, on October 24, 1984, TV Bauru was renamed Rede Globo Oeste Paulista. US$2.5 million were invested in the purchase of new equipment and the creation of branches in the municipalities of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto, Mar\u00edlia and Presidente Prudente, and three months later, a branch was also created in Ara\u00e7atuba, covering 260 municipalities from the interior of the state. The number of journalism teams now stood at 11, and SPTV, which until then occupied only a small block of news bulletins generated in S\u00e3o Paulo, gains two editions, at 12:45 pm and 7:45 pm.[3] On April 21, 1986, the station's branches in Ara\u00e7atuba and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto were separated, and TV Globo Noroeste Paulista was created, also following the same pattern as the Bauru station.[4] On July 9, 1990, Rede Globo stations in S\u00e3o Paulo replaced SPTV with SP J\u00e1, with the first edition being relayed from Globo S\u00e3o Paulo, and the second produced locally by TV Globo Oeste Paulista. On April 11, 1994, with the return of Jornal Hoje to the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, the first edition of SP J\u00e1 also began to be produced by Globo Oeste Paulista. It was also in that year that, with the emergence of TV Fronteira Paulista, on June 1, the broadcaster stopped covering the Mesoregion of Presidente Prudente, restricting its coverage, which in 1984 was from 260 municipalities to 113 municipalities. In 1996, SP J\u00e1 was axed and the station returned to produce SPTV. In the late 1990s, Central Globo de Affiliadas e Expans\u00e3o launched the \"Projeto Regional do Futuro\", which aimed to give greater autonomy to Rede Globo's O&Os in inland S\u00e3o Paulo and also to TV Globo Juiz de Fora in Minas Gerais, as well as the expansion of local programming and interaction with the local community.[6] With this, TV Globo Oeste Paulista is renamed TV Modelo, and new programs werre also created, such as Modelo Esporte, shown before the S\u00e3o Paulo version of Globo Esporte; Comunidade no Ar, a bulletin shown during the program that showed actions by philanthropic entities, NGOs, among others; Intera\u00e7\u00e3o, a weekly magazine program shown on Saturdays, and Nosso Campo, a program about local agribusiness, which was produced together with TV Fronteira, TV Progresso in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto and TV Alian\u00e7a Paulista in Sorocaba. The station also showed Terra da Gente, which was produced by EPTV Campinas.[3] Regional campaigns and projects were also implemented, such as the \"Campanha do Agasalho\", \"Semana da Faxina\", \"M\u00fasica na Pra\u00e7a\", \"Recrean\u00e7a\", as well as \"A\u00e7\u00e3o Global\", carried out in partnership with SESI, as well as sporting events such as the Copa TV Modelo de Futsal and the Copa de V\u00f4lei de Praia TV Modelo. All of these events aimed to bring the identity of the broadcaster and others even closer to the region where they were established, and most of them still occur today. This regionalization also affected the broadcaster's journalism, when SPTV, following the remodeling of Globo's local journalism standard, began to have an editorial line closer to the community.[3] In 2002, Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es Globo incurred a huge debt resulting from investments in Globosat channels and pay TV companies, which exceeded R$2 billion in October of that year. As a way to alleviate expenses, Rede Globo sold its shares in 15 broadcasters in which it had a stake or were owned by it. In this way, 90% of TV Modelo's shares, along with another 90% of TV Progresso in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto and TV Alian\u00e7a Paulista in Sorocaba were sold to businessman Jos\u00e9 Hawilla (owner of the Traffic Group, a sports marketing company), for a value between R$120 and 180 million.[7][3] On May 6, 2003, with the purchase already approved by CADE and the Ministry of Communications, the TV stations in Bauru, Sorocaba and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto began to form TV TEM (acronym for Traffic Entertainment and Marketing), which together with the Itapetininga station, founded on the same day, it now covers 318 municipalities in the interior of S\u00e3o Paulo, totaling 49% of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. TV Modelo then changed its name to TV TEM Bauru, and the programs shown until then were extinguished and replaced by Bom Dia Cidade, successor to the local block of Bom Dia S\u00e3o Paulo, and TEM Not\u00edcias, successor to SPTV . The remaining programs will be produced by TV TEM Sorocaba, the network's parent company.[4] Following the decision taken by Globo to end its contract with TV Fronteira due to political scandals, TV TEM Bauru will cover Presidente Prudente again effective January 1, 2025.[8] The transition was later delayed to August 30th of that year.[9] The station inaugurated its digital signal on July 23, 2012, in a ceremony held at its headquarters in Bauru.[10] The president of TV TEM, J.Hawilla, and the director of Central Globo de Afiliadas, Cl\u00e1udia Quaresma, symbolically pressed a button that activated the broadcaster's digital signal, via UHF channel 26.[11] The station's news programs, however, began to be shown in high definition only on June 2, 2015, with the exception of programs retransmitted from TV TEM Sorocaba already shown in the format.[12] Based on the federal decree transitioning Brazilian TV stations from analogue to digital signals, TV TEM Bauru, as well as the other stations in Bauru, ceased broadcasting on VHF channel 2 on March 28, 2018, following the official schedule from ANATEL.[13] In addition to retransmitting Globo's national programming, TV TEM currently produces and broadcasts the following programs: Relayed from TV TEM Sorocaba, the head station: Relayed from TV Globo S\u00e3o Paulo",

The station was responsible for producing several variety programs, musical shows, the news program Nosso Jornal, and even a local telenovela that was written and also starred by Clorinda Resta. Several professionals from the city's radio stations also migrated to the new means of communication.[3][4] However, the difficulties in maintaining a high-profile television station were enormous.

There were few advertisers for the channel, and with money missing from the till, many employees received payments after the due date.[5] All these factors led Simonetti to sell the station to Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es Victor Costa in October of the same year. With the purchase, there was also a considerable increase in the programming range, with the addition of North American slots and programs relayed from TV Paulista, which was also owned by OVC.[3] In May 1965, Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es Victor Costa were sold to Roberto Marinho, who incorporated his outlets into Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es Globo. With this, TV Bauru became an owned-and-operated station of Rede Globo, together with TV Paulista, which in 1967 was renamed TV Globo S\u00e3o Paulo. Under the direction of Arceno Athas, local productions are gradually being phased out, and only journalism is being prioritized. The programs Globo Interior and Globo Agora \u00e0 Noite stood out at that time, which were produced and also presented by journalists such as Roberto Purini, Edson Fagnani, Jo\u00e3o Dias Antunes and Fred Calmon. However, these programs were gradually replaced by Jornal Nacional, broadcast via satellite. In 1971, with the emergence of Jornal Hoje, the station created a local version of the newscast presented by Alonso Padilha, however, this was gradually replaced by the S\u00e3o Paulo version presented by Mar\u00edlia Gabriela. The station reached the end of the 1970s with only a reporting team made up of reporter Jair Acetuno, cameramen Moacir Mendon\u00e7a and Walcir Coelho, and lighting designer Carlos Corrente, who together only produced reports shown during Jornal das Sete, produced in S\u00e3o Paulo.[4] On February 28, 1980, the station started showing a"

In the meantime, on October 24, 1984, TV Bauru was renamed Rede Globo Oeste Paulista. US$2.5 million were invested in the purchase of new equipment and the creation of branches in the municipalities of S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto, Mar\u00edlia and Presidente Prudente, and three months later, a branch was also created in Ara\u00e7atuba, covering 260 municipalities from the interior of the state. The number of journalism teams now stood at 11, and SPTV, which until then occupied only a small block of news bulletins generated in S\u00e3o Paulo, gains two editions, at 12:45 pm and 7:45 pm.[3] On April 21, 1986, the station's branches in Ara\u00e7atuba and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto were separated, and TV Globo Noroeste Paulista was created, also following the same pattern as the Bauru station.[4] On July 9, 1990, Rede Globo stations in S\u00e3o Paulo replaced SPTV with SP J\u00e1, with the first edition being relayed from Globo S\u00e3o Paulo, and the second produced locally by TV Globo Oeste Paulista. On April 11, 1994, with the return of Jornal Hoje to the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, the first edition of SP J\u00e1 also began to be produced by Globo Oeste Paulista.

It was also in that year that, with the emergence of TV Fronteira Paulista, on June 1, the broadcaster stopped covering the Mesoregion of Presidente Prudente, restricting its coverage, which in 1984 was from 260 municipalities to 113 municipalities. In 1996, SP J\u00e1 was axed and the station returned to produce SPTV. In the late 1990s, Central Globo de Affiliadas e Expans\u00e3o launched the \"Projeto Regional do Futuro\", which aimed to give greater autonomy to Rede Globo's O&Os in inland S\u00e3o Paulo and also to TV Globo Juiz de Fora in Minas Gerais, as well as the expansion of local programming and interaction with the local community.[6] With this, TV Globo Oeste Paulista is renamed TV Modelo, and new programs werre also created, such as Modelo Esporte, shown before the S\u00e3o Paulo version of Globo Esporte; Comunidade no Ar, a bulletin shown during the program that showed actions by philanthropic entities, NGOs, among others; Intera\u00e7\u00e3o, a weekly magazine program shown on Saturdays, and Nosso Campo, a program about local agribusiness, which was produced together with TV Fronteira, TV Progresso in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto and TV Alian\u00e7a Paulista in Sorocaba. The station also showed Terra da Gente, which was produced by EPTV Campinas.[3] Regional campaigns and projects were also implemented, such as the \"Campanha do Agasalho\", \"Semana da Faxina\", \"M\u00fasica na Pra\u00e7a\", \"Recrean\u00e7a\", as well as \"A\u00e7\u00e3o Global\", carried out in partnership with SESI, as well as sporting events such as the Copa TV Modelo de Futsal and the Copa de V\u00f4lei de Praia TV Modelo.

All of these events aimed to bring the identity of the broadcaster and others even closer to the region where they were established, and most of them still occur today. This regionalization also affected the broadcaster's journalism, when SPTV, following the remodeling of Globo's local journalism standard, began to have an editorial line closer to the community.[3] In 2002, Organiza\u00e7\u00f5es Globo incurred a huge debt resulting from investments in Globosat channels and pay TV companies, which exceeded R$2 billion in October of that year. As a way to alleviate expenses, Rede Globo sold its shares in 15 broadcasters in which it had a stake or were owned by it. In this way, 90% of TV Modelo's shares, along with another 90% of TV Progresso in S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto and TV Alian\u00e7a Paulista in Sorocaba were sold to businessman Jos\u00e9 Hawilla (owner of the Traffic Group, a sports marketing company), for a value between R$120 and 180 million.[7][3] On May 6, 2003, with the purchase already approved by CADE and the Ministry of Communications, the TV stations in Bauru, Sorocaba and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto began to form TV TEM (acronym for Traffic Entertainment and Marketing), which together with the Itapetininga station, founded on the same day, it now covers 318 municipalities in the interior of S\u00e3o Paulo, totaling 49% of the state of S\u00e3o Paulo.

The remaining programs will be produced by TV TEM Sorocaba, the network's parent company.[4] Following the decision taken by Globo to end its contract with TV Fronteira due to political scandals, TV TEM Bauru will cover Presidente Prudente again effective January 1, 2025.[8] The transition was later delayed to August 30th of that year.[9] The station inaugurated its digital signal on July 23, 2012, in a ceremony held at its headquarters in Bauru.[10] The president of TV TEM, J.Hawilla, and the director of Central Globo de Afiliadas, Cl\u00e1udia Quaresma, symbolically pressed a button that activated the broadcaster's digital signal, via UHF channel 26.[11] The station's news programs, however, began to be shown in high definition only on June 2, 2015, with the exception of programs retransmitted from TV TEM Sorocaba already shown in the format.[12] Based on the federal decree transitioning Brazilian TV stations from analogue to digital signals, TV TEM Bauru, as well as the other stations in Bauru, ceased broadcasting on VHF channel 2 on March 28, 2018, following the official schedule from ANATEL.[13] In addition to retransmitting Globo's national programming, TV TEM currently produces and broadcasts the following programs: Relayed from TV TEM Sorocaba, the head station: Relayed from TV Globo S\u00e3o Paulo"

        "text": "Boston, Massachusetts, is home to several major professional sports franchises. They include the Red Sox (baseball), the Celtics (basketball, in the state where the sport was invented), and the Bruins (ice hockey). The New England Patriots (American football) and the New England Revolution (soccer) play at Gillette Stadium in the nearby suburb of Foxborough, Massachusetts. Boston is one of eleven U.S. cities to have teams from the five major American professional team sports. Several Boston-area colleges and universities are also active in college athletics including: Boston College, Boston University, Northeastern, and Harvard. The city is also home to prestigious sports events such as the Boston Marathon and the Head of the Charles Regatta. Sports are a major part of the city's culture (as well as the culture of the Greater Boston area). Boston sports fans are known for their fanatical devotion to the Red Sox and knowledge of the team's history. However, in recent memory Boston is now known as an American football town, as the Patriots have long seized the title as the most popular team in New England, according to surveys.[1][2] Fenway Park, home of the Red Sox, is the oldest ballpark in Major League Baseball (MLB) and holds a legendary status among baseball fans.[3][4][5] Within the same era, what is now the world's oldest existing indoor multi-sports facility[6] \u2013 today's Matthews Arena, primarily used by Northeastern University's college sports teams \u2013 first opened in 1910, only 1\u20444-mile (400m) away from the original home field of the Red Sox \u2013 and is where on December 1, 1924, the Boston Bruins played their first NHL regular season game.[7] The Greater Boston region is the only city/surrounding area in American professional sports in which all facilities for men's teams are privately owned and operated. The Patriots and Revolution both own Gillette Stadium, the Red Sox own Fenway Park, and TD Garden is owned by Delaware North, owner of the Bruins. The Celtics rent TD Garden from Delaware North. This is not the case for teams in the most prominent women's leagues\u2014Boston Fleet, the region's representative in the Professional Women's Hockey League, plays at the Tsongas Center, owned by the University of Massachusetts Lowell, and the National Women's Soccer League's future Boston Legacy FC is set to start play in 2026 in White Stadium, owned by Boston's public school district. 9 World Series titles 1 World Series title 6 Super Bowl titles 18 NBA Finals titles 6 Stanley Cup titles 1 Avco World Trophy Since the turn of the century, Boston's professional sports teams have won 13 championships: six by the Patriots (Super Bowls XXXVI (2001), XXXVIII (2003), XXXIX (2004), XLIX (2014), LI (2016), and LIII (2018)), four by the Red Sox (2004, 2007, 2013, and 2018), two by the Celtics (2008 and 2024), and one by the Bruins (2011). Their sports teams have also appeared an additional 12 times as league finalists: five by the Revolution (2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2014), three by the Patriots (Super Bowls XLII (2007), XLVI (2011), and LII (2017)), two by the Bruins (2013, and 2019) and two by the Celtics (2010 and 2022). The recent sporting success of their teams has given rise to the city's moniker as the \"City of Champions\",[8][9][10][11] and \"Titletown\".[12][13][14] In the 2000s, Boston's professional teams had what was argued to be the most successful decade in sports history, winning six championships (three by the Patriots: 2001, 2003, 2004; two by the Red Sox: 2004, 2007; and one by the Celtics: 2007\u201308),[15] while also appearing an additional five times as league finalists (4x by the Revolution, 1x by the Patriots). Additionally, their teams have completed their regular seasons with the best record five times in their respective leagues (3x by the Patriots: 14\u20132 in 2003, 14\u20132 in 2004, 16\u20130 in 2007; 2x by the Celtics: 66\u201316 in 2007\u201308, 62\u201320 in 2008\u201309). In the 2010s, their professional teams rivaled their 2000s achievements, winning six additional championships (three by the Patriots: 2014, 2016, 2018; two by the Red Sox: 2013, 2018; and one by the Bruins: 2010\u201311), while also appearing an additional six times as league finalists (2x by the Patriots, 2x by the Bruins, 1x by the Celtics, and 1x by the Revolution). Additionally, their teams have completed their regular seasons with the best record four times in their respective leagues (2x by the Patriots: 14\u20132 in 2010, 14\u20132 in 2016; one Presidents' Trophy by the Bruins: 117 PTS in 2013\u201314; 1x by the Red Sox: 108\u201354 in 2018). In the 2020s, the Celtics won a championship in 2024, while also appearing an additional time as a league finalist in 2022. Additionally, Boston's professional teams have completed their regular seasons with the best record four times in their respective leagues (two presidents' Trophies by the Bruins: 100 PTS in 2019\u201320, 135 PTS in 2022\u201323; one Supporters' Shield by the Revolution: 22\u20135\u20137 in 2021; 1x by the Celtics: 64\u201318 in 2023\u201324). When the Bruins won the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, the city of Boston became the first city in the 21st century to have at least four of its major professional league teams win a league championship, and became the first city to have championships in four major professional leagues within a ten-year span, accomplishing this feat in a span of six years, four months, and nine days (from the Patriots' championship win on February 6, 2005, to the Bruins' championship win on June 15, 2011).[16] Los Angeles would accomplish this same feat in 2022.[17] This sporting achievement was what Dan Shaughnessy of Sports Illustrated dubbed as Boston completing the \"Grand Slam of North American sports.\"[18]\nAs of April 2025, at least one of Boston's five major pro sports teams has played in the final four of their respective sports playoffs, MLB's ALCS, NFL's AFC Championship Game, or the Eastern Conference Finals in the NBA, NHL, and MLS in every year since 2010.\nSince 2002, duck boats provided by Boston Duck Tours have been used as Boston's championship parade vehicles, starting with the New England Patriots after the Patriots won Super Bowl XXXVI over the St. Louis Rams. As a result of this recent practice, the catch phrase \"cue the duck boats\" has been used whenever a Boston sports team has won a championship in advance of its celebratory parade.[19][20][21][22][23] While much of the parade routes over the years consisted of the duck boats staying on land, some featured them traversing both the land and across the Charles River. According to American folklore, Pilgrim fathers observed a form of soccer called pasuckuakohowog that was played by Native Americans along the Massachusetts coast as early as 1620, the earliest observance of soccer of any form in what is currently the United States.[24] In 1862, The Oneida Football Club in Boston was the first organized team to play any kind of \"football/soccer\" in the United States. It was founded by Gerrit Smith \"Gat\" Miller, a graduate of the Latin School of Epes Sargent Dixwell, a private college preparatory school in Boston, who grew tired of the chaotic, disorganized, and very violent games that arose from different schools, as well as the rule variations of soccer that existed as a by-product of no formal rules for the game during that era. Miller organized other recent preparatory school graduates from relatively elite public (state) schools in the area, such as Boston Latin School and the English High School of Boston to join this team that played their games at Boston Common. Between 1862 and 1865, playing against other pickup teams within Boston's collegiate community, the Oneidas never lost a match.[25] Like American football historians, soccer historians trace the origins of their sport in the region to the Oneida Football Club and their brand of football that they played called the \"Boston Game\", which was a hybrid of both sports today that featured a rounded ball that could be kicked, carried, and thrown. The Boston game would go on to be introduced to Yale University, Columbia University, Cornell University, and Boston's Harvard University. This hybrid form of football, that would evolve into what is now American football, would eventually adopt codified rules based primarily on those established for English rugby, gained prominence and acceptance within the college circles, and upper-class status, relegating the uncodified \"soccer\" variety of the game to working-class status, that was adopted by the immigrant communities that brought along their soccer customs and traditions with them to the region. In 1923, the world's first indoor soccer league with 11-a-side teams on a full-sized field opened the winter season at the Commonwealth Cavalry Armory in Boston. In 1924, the Boston Soccer Club was formed and played in the professional American Soccer League, which comprised teams based in the northeastern U.S. region. The team was later renamed the Boston Bears in 1929 and played for an additional few seasons before the league folded in 1933 due to the Great Depression in the United States. At the inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930, Bert Patenaude (from Fall River, Massachusetts) scored the first hat-trick in World Cup play.[26] The USMNT finished in third place.[27] 1967 brought about the birth of nationwide professional soccer featuring two competing leagues. Of the two, Boston only played in the United Soccer Association and was represented by the Boston Rovers, whose roster was composed of players from Shamrock Rovers F.C. from the League of Ireland as well as guest players. They played their home matches at the Manning Bowl in Lynn, Massachusetts. In 1968, the United Soccer Association and the National Professional Soccer League merged to become the FIFA-backed, major professional North American Soccer League (NASL). Boston was represented that year by the Boston Beacons who played their lone season at Fenway Park. In 1974\u201376, Boston was represented in the league by the Boston Minutemen who played their home games in various stadiums within Greater Boston, including Nickerson Field and Foxboro Stadium. From 1978 to 1980, Greater Boston was represented in the league by the New England Tea Men who played out of Foxboro Stadium. The team would relocate to Jacksonville, Florida after three seasons. After the NASL folded on March 28, 1985, a new nationwide professional soccer league would re-emerge in 1996 in the form of Major League Soccer (MLS) following the success of the 1994 FIFA World Cup (with Foxboro Stadium as one of nine venues).[28] Greater Boston would be represented by the New England Revolution, who play all their home games in Foxborough, Massachusetts. Gillette Stadium has served as the Revolution's current home stadium since 2002. The club's nickname \"Revolution\" refers to the New England region's significant involvement in the American Revolutionary War that took place from 1775 to 1783. The Revolution have participated in five MLS Cup finals in 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2014, but have not yet won. They won the 2021 MLS Supporters' Shield for the best regular season record.[29] Notable footballers who played in Boston include Portuguese legend Eus\u00e9bio, and U.S. national team members: Taylor Twellman, Clint Dempsey, Alexi Lalas, and Billy Gonsalves (a native of Fall River, Massachusetts and was nicknamed the \"Babe Ruth of American Soccer\" during his career).[30][31] The Boston Celtics basketball team, who play at the TD Garden, were a founding member of the Basketball Association of America, one of the two leagues that merged to form the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Celtics have the distinction of having more championships than any other NBA team, with eighteen championships from 1957 to 2024.[32]   They had a remarkable run of titles from the 1956\u201357 until the 1968\u201369 seasons, winning 11 of 13 championships in that span, including an NBA record 8 titles in a row from 1958 to 1959 until 1965\u201366, under legendary center Bill Russell. The list of Celtics who are members of the Basketball Hall of Fame include, among others, Bill Russell, Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, Dave Cowens, Larry Bird, Sam Jones, Nate Archibald, original owner Walter Brown, and longtime coach and team president Red Auerbach, who worked for the team until his death in 2006 at age 89. Longtime announcer Johnny Most was also honored by the Basketball Hall of Fame as a recipient of the Curt Gowdy Media Award. After finishing with a record of 24\u201358 in 2006\u201307, the team acquired Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett from the Seattle SuperSonics and Minnesota Timberwolves, respectively, to aid longtime Celtics star Paul Pierce make up one of the best defensive and offensive lineups in NBA history. With help of up-and-coming Rajon Rondo, Kendrick Perkins, and head coach Doc Rivers the team once again made history by winning the 2008 NBA Finals and their 17th championship against long-time rivals the Lakers. One of the most notable athletes from Greater Boston was Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing who grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts and attended the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School.[33] Ewing won Olympic gold medals as a member of the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men's basketball teams[34] and was selected as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996 and as one of the 75 Greatest Players in NBA History in 2021.[35] The TD Garden, above North Station, is the home to the Boston Bruins ice hockey team of the National Hockey League (NHL). The Bruins, founded in 1924, were the first American member of the NHL and an Original Six franchise, and have won six Stanley Cups, most recently in 2011, when they defeated the Vancouver Canucks in seven games. The Bruins' first venue\u2014the team is the only one of the Original Six teams to have its original venue still in existence\u2014was the former Boston Arena on Huntington Avenue, having been built in 1910 under that name, which now exists as Northeastern University's Matthews Arena. It is the oldest purpose-built indoor ice hockey arena still in use in the world for the sport, used for Northeastern Huskies collegiate ice hockey and basketball in the 21st century. Hall of Fame players such as forward Milt Schmidt, and defensemen Eddie Shore, Raymond Bourque and the legendary Bobby Orr have played for the Bruins, as well as the NHL's tallest-ever player, Slovakian-born defenseman Zdeno Ch\u00e1ra, a former captain of the Bruins. The team has been managed and coached by Hall of Famers such as team founder Charles Adams (namesake of hockey's old Adams Division), Art Ross (donor and namesake of the NHL's trophy for annual scoring champion), Walter A. Brown, Schmidt, and Harry Sinden. Orr was voted the greatest athlete in Boston history in the Boston Globe newspaper's poll of New Englanders in 1975, beating out baseball and basketball stars such as Ted Williams, Bill Russell, Carl Yastrzemski, and Bob Cousy.[36] Since their initial meeting on December 8, 1924, the longest-standing rivalry in the NHL is the one between the Bruins and their Canadian archrival, the Montreal Canadiens.[37] These two teams have met 34 times in the NHL's Stanley Cup playoffs, with Montreal taking 18-straight playoff series from the Bruins between 1946 and 1987. Boston's local colleges are also very strong in hockey. Boston College and Boston University are always competitive and at the top of the college rankings, both competing in the Hockey East conference. Since 2001, Boston College has won four national championships (2001, 2008, 2010, and 2012) and Boston University has won one (2009). BC and BU, along with the Northeastern Huskies, also of Hockey East, and the Harvard Crimson of ECAC Hockey, compete in the Beanpot, considered[by whom?] the most prestigious in-season collegiate hockey tournament. It is played on the first two Mondays of February at TD Garden, with the semi-final matchups rotating on a year-to-year basis. Although neither the BC or BU women's teams have secured national championships, they have together eight Hockey East titles since 2010. Boston also has a rich recent history in professional women's hockey. The Boston Pride were a charter franchise of the National Women's Hockey League (NWHL) and its most successful team, winning three Isobel Cup titles. The NWHL, which rebranded as the Premier Hockey Federation in 2021, was purchased and ultimately dissolved in 2023 as part of an effort to create a new, unified North American women's professional league.[38] Boston was awarded one of the new Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL) six charter franchises.[39] Boston Fleet hosts games in Lowell, and debuted on January 3, 2024.[40] In the inaugural season, Boston Fleet made it to the finals competing for the Walter Cup, but lost to Minnesota Frost in Game 5.[41] The Boston Red Sox are a founding member of the American League of Major League Baseball (MLB), and one of the four American League teams (the White Sox, Guardians, and Tigers are the others) to still play in their original city. The \"BoSox\", or \"Sox\" as they are colloquially called, play their home games at Fenway Park, located near Kenmore Square, in the Fenway section of Boston. Built in 1912, it is the oldest sports arena or stadium in active use in the United States among the four major professional sports.\nBoston was also the site of the first game of the first baseball World Series, in 1903. The Boston-New York baseball rivalry has existed since May 7, 1903: the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry, with the New York team then being known as the \"Highlanders\", from their Upper Manhattan home field location. The 1903 World Series was played between the Red Sox (then known as the \"Americans\") and the Pittsburgh Pirates,[42] while the team still played at the Huntington Avenue Grounds (the site is now a part of Northeastern University). The Sox won that series and eight more since then (1912, 1915, 1916, 1918, 2004, 2007, 2013, and 2018). The 2004 team is said to have broken the 86-year-long \"Curse of the Bambino.\" There have been many legendary players on the team including Cy Young, Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Carl Yastrzemski, Carlton Fisk, Wade Boggs, Jim Rice, Pedro Mart\u00ednez, Roger Clemens, and David Ortiz. For the first half of the 20th century, Boston had two Major League Baseball franchises. The Boston Braves, operated in the National League from 1871 to 1952 before relocating to Milwaukee, and finally moving to their current home, Atlanta. They played their home games at South End Grounds (1871\u20131914) and Braves Field (1915\u20131952). In 1914, the Braves performed one of the most memorable comebacks in major league history, going from last place to first place in two months, becoming the first team to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July. The Braves went on to sweep Connie Mack's heavily favored Athletics in four games in the 1914 World Series. The franchise is the oldest continuous professional sports franchise. The Boston Game is thought to be the origin of American football, played by New England prep schools. In 1855, manufactured inflatable balls were introduced. These were much more regular in shape than the handmade balls of earlier times, making kicking and carrying more skillful. Two competing versions had evolved during this time; the \"kicking game\" which resembled soccer and the \"running\" or \"carrying game\" which resembled rugby union.  hybrid of the two, known as the \"Boston game\", was played by a group known as the Oneida Football Club. The club, considered by some historians as the first formal football club in the United States, was formed in 1861 by schoolboys who played the \"Boston game\" on Boston Common. They played mostly among themselves early on; though they organized a team of non-members to play a game in November 1863, which the Oneidas won easily. The game caught the attention of the press, and the \"Boston game\" continued to grow throughout the 1860s.[43] The first professional National Football League (NFL) franchise in the city was the Boston Bulldogs, who only played a single season (in 1929) since relocating from Pottsville, Pennsylvania. The Boston Braves were established in 1932, under the ownership of George Preston Marshall. At the time the team played in Braves Field, home of the Boston Braves baseball team in the National League. The following year, the club moved to Fenway Park, home of the American League's Boston Red Sox, whereupon owners changed the team's name to \"Boston Redskins.\" To round out the change, Marshall hired William \"Lone Star\" Dietz, who was thought to be part Sioux, as the team's head coach. However, Boston wasn't much of a football town at the time and the team had difficulty drawing fans. In fact, the 1936 NFL Championship Game was moved to the Polo Grounds in New York City due to apathy and low support in Boston. In 1937, Marshall moved the franchise to Washington, D.C. In 1944, the Boston Yanks were established (the 3rd NFL franchise in Boston's history), playing their home games at Fenway Park and competing until 1948. The Yanks are the only officially defunct NFL team ever to have the first overall NFL draft pick. They had it twice, in 1944 and 1946. Both times they selected a quarterback from the University of Notre Dame: Angelo Bertelli (1944) and Frank Dancewicz (1946), both Massachusetts natives. Owner Ted Collins moved his \"defunct\" Yanks franchise to New York City in 1949, where it continued for one year as the Bulldogs and two years known as the New York Yanks. In 1959, Boston businessman Billy Sullivan was awarded a franchise in the American Football League (AFL), the Boston Patriots, bringing professional football back to Boston. Throughout the 1960s, the team lacked a permanent home field, playing at Boston University Field (at the time still known and configured as Braves Field), Fenway Park, Harvard Stadium, and Boston College's Alumni Stadium. In 1970, the AFL merged with the NFL and the Patriots joined the league (the AFL- NFL merger was announced in 1966, the first season of Super Bowl competition). The following year, the franchise was re-named the New England Patriots. From 1971 to 2002, the team played at Foxboro Stadium in the town of Foxborough, Massachusetts which is located 22 miles (45\u00a0km)[44][45] southwest of downtown Boston. Unlike most major American cities, Boston was slow to get a professional-caliber stadium, which stymied past attempts at top-tier football in the city prior to the Patriots' arrival. Largely due to the stadium issue, the Patriots are the only football team in the Boston area's sporting history to survive more than five years. The 2002 season brought the opening of Gillette Stadium, located next door to Foxboro Stadium. Businessman Robert Kraft, who at the time owned Foxboro Stadium and the team's lease for it, purchased the team in 1994 for $175\u00a0million, ensuring the Patriots would remain in New England amid a shuffle of owners and rumors of a relocation to St. Louis. The team experienced a recent surge of success, mostly with the turn of the century. The team has made 11 Super Bowl appearances and won six of them \u2013 XXXVI (2001), XXXVIII (2003), XXXIX (2004), XLIX (2014), LI (2016), LIII (2018) \u2013 and became the only team to go 16\u20130 in the regular season (in 2007) since the NFL expanded to a 16-game schedule in 1978. Notable people among the team include head coach Bill Belichick and star quarterback Tom Brady, who among others would help make the Patriots consistently successful. The Patriots won 21 games in a row from 2003 to 2004, including winning Super Bowl XXXVIII. The only substantive challenge to the Patriots came from the United States Football League's Boston Breakers, who played at Nickerson Field in the upstart spring league's inaugural season. However, by the end of that season, it was clear that Nickerson Field was too small and too outdated even for temporary use. Unable to find a more suitable venue, the Breakers moved to New Orleans the following season. Rugby in Boston has a strong following; the city is home to numerous amateur, college and semi-professional sides. The city has three teams in the former premier division of USA rugby union, the Rugby Super League \u2013 Mystic River Rugby Club, the Boston Irish Wolfhounds, and Boston RFC.  The current top flight of the sport, Major League Rugby, has the Boston-based New England Free Jacks who joined the league in 2020. The team has won  three consecutive MLR shields and becoming the first team earned the most titles in franchise history. The Boston 13s founded in 2009, play in the North Conference of the USA Rugby League, they won the USARL National Championship in 2015. 7 WFA titles (2011, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2023) Boston is home to three professional lacrosse teams, including the Boston Cannons of Major League Lacrosse, who played at Harvard University's Harvard Stadium. The National Lacrosse League team in Boston is the Boston Blazers, who began in the 2009 season and played at the TD Garden.  The Boston Storm, who began in the 2016 season, were one of the original four teams of the United Women's Lacrosse League. Two different women's soccer teams known as the Boston Breakers have been charter members of three separate professional leagues. The original version, founded in 2001, played in the short-lived Women's United Soccer Association. The Breakers were resurrected in 2009 to play in WUSA's equally short-lived successor, Women's Professional Soccer (WPS). After WPS folded following its 2011 season, the Breakers remained in operation, playing the 2012 season in the newly established semi-pro WPSL Elite. In December 2012, the Breakers were announced as one of the eight charter teams of the new National Women's Soccer League, which began play in 2013. While the WUSA and WPS Breakers played at Harvard Stadium, the NWSL team played its first season at the smaller Dilboy Stadium in Somerville. The NWSL Breakers moved to Harvard Stadium for the 2014 season, and then moved to the nearby venue now known as Jordan Field, where they remained until their demise after the 2017 season. In September 2023, the NWSL announced that a Boston team would start play in 2026.[48] The team announced its branding as BOS Nation FC in October 2024.[49] Due to fan backlash, the team announced it would change its name to Boston Legacy FC on March 26, 2025. There have been other professional sports teams to play in the city, such as the Boston Beacons and Boston Minutemen of the NASL. Boston's first all-female flat-track roller derby league, Boston Derby Dames, formed in May 2005. The league is among the original members of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association. Boston's many colleges and universities are active in college athletics. There are four NCAA Division I members in the city: Boston College (member of the Atlantic Coast Conference), Boston University (Patriot League), Northeastern University (Coastal Athletic Association), and Harvard University (Ivy League). All except Harvard, which belongs to ECAC Hockey, belong to the Hockey East conference in hockey. The hockey teams of these four universities meet every year in a four-team tournament known as the \"Beanpot Tournament\", played at the TD Garden (and the Boston Garden before that) over two Monday nights in February.[50] The oldest continuously used indoor and outdoor sports stadiums in the world are used by Boston schools: Harvard Stadium (built in 1903) and the aforementioned Boston Arena (now known as Matthews Arena, built in 1910), which is used by Northeastern University. Boston has amateur and participatory sports and recreation.\nThe 18-mile loop through the Paul Dudley White Bicycle Path runs on both sides of the river within the Charles River Reservation for bicyclists and runners. Boston is also home is the oldest continuously operating community sailing program in the United States.[citation needed] It is located in Boston along the Charles River Esplanade between the Longfellow Bridge and the Hatch Shell.\nCommunity Boating, Inc offers members instruction for sailing and windsurfing, and allows members to use CBI-owned sailboats on the Charles River. The Boston Ski and Sports Club offers team sports leagues in Basketball, Ultimate, Dodgeball, Football, Tennis, Volleyball, Golf, and other indoor and outdoor sports. The city is home to the Boston Marathon, one of the best known sporting events in the city. It is a 42.195-kilometre (26.219\u00a0mi) run from Hopkinton to Copley Square in the Back Bay and the world's oldest annual marathon,[51] running on Patriots' Day in April. The city is home to the Head of the Charles Regatta. Longwood Cricket Club (despite its name) is the oldest tennis club in the New World,[citation needed] located in Chestnut Hill. It is the site of the first Davis Cup competition.\nBoston is the start and finish for the Boston\u2013Montreal\u2013Boston cycling event. Boston's TD Garden is expected to host the 2020 Laver Cup, an international men's tennis tournament between two teams (Team World vs Team Europe). John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg will reprise their roles as captains in this fourth edition of the tournament.[52] In January 2015, the city was picked by the United States Olympic Committee to represent the nation in the bidding for the 2024 Olympic Games. But seven months later, the city withdrew itself from consideration amid concerns of the financial burdens associated with hosting the Olympics.[53] Los Angeles was then selected as the US candidate and was ultimately awarded the right to host the 2028 Summer Olympics. Boston is one of the eleven U.S. host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[54]",

According to American folklore, Pilgrim fathers observed a form of soccer called pasuckuakohowog that was played by Native Americans along the Massachusetts coast as early as 1620, the earliest observance of soccer of any form in what is currently the United States.[24] In 1862, The Oneida Football Club in Boston was the first organized team to play any kind of \"football/soccer\" in the United States. It was founded by Gerrit Smith \"Gat\" Miller, a graduate of the Latin School of Epes Sargent Dixwell, a private college preparatory school in Boston, who grew tired of the chaotic, disorganized, and very violent games that arose from different schools, as well as the rule variations of soccer that existed as a by-product of no formal rules for the game during that era. Miller organized other recent preparatory school graduates from relatively elite public (state) schools in the area, such as Boston Latin School and the English High School of Boston to join this team that played their games at Boston Common. Between 1862 and 1865, playing against other pickup teams within Boston's collegiate community, the Oneidas never lost a match.[25] Like American football historians, soccer historians trace the origins of their sport in the region to the Oneida Football Club and their brand of football that they played called the \"Boston Game\", which was a"

The Boston game would go on to be introduced to Yale University, Columbia University, Cornell University, and Boston's Harvard University. This hybrid form of football, that would evolve into what is now American football, would eventually adopt codified rules based primarily on those established for English rugby, gained prominence and acceptance within the college circles, and upper-class status, relegating the uncodified \"soccer\" variety of the game to working-class status, that was adopted by the immigrant communities that brought along their soccer customs and traditions with them to the region. In 1923, the world's first indoor soccer league with 11-a-side teams on a full-sized field opened the winter season at the Commonwealth Cavalry Armory in Boston. In 1924, the Boston Soccer Club was formed and played in the professional American Soccer League, which comprised teams based in the northeastern U.S. region. The team was later renamed the Boston Bears in 1929 and played for an additional few seasons before the league folded in 1933 due to the Great Depression in the United States.

They played their home matches at the Manning Bowl in Lynn, Massachusetts. In 1968, the United Soccer Association and the National Professional Soccer League merged to become the FIFA-backed, major professional North American Soccer League (NASL). Boston was represented that year by the Boston Beacons who played their lone season at Fenway Park. In 1974\u201376, Boston was represented in the league by the Boston Minutemen who played their home games in various stadiums within Greater Boston, including Nickerson Field and Foxboro Stadium. From 1978 to 1980, Greater Boston was represented in the league by the New England Tea Men who played out of Foxboro Stadium. The team would relocate to Jacksonville, Florida after three seasons. After the NASL folded on March 28, 1985, a new nationwide professional soccer league would re-emerge in 1996 in the form of Major League Soccer (MLS) following the success of the 1994 FIFA World Cup (with Foxboro Stadium as one of nine venues).[28] Greater Boston would be represented by the New England Revolution, who play all their home games in Foxborough, Massachusetts.

The Celtics have the distinction of having more championships than any other NBA team, with eighteen championships from 1957 to 2024.[32] They had a remarkable run of titles from the 1956\u201357 until the 1968\u201369 seasons, winning 11 of 13 championships in that span, including an NBA record 8 titles in a row from 1958 to 1959 until 1965\u201366, under legendary center Bill Russell.

One of the most notable athletes from Greater Boston was Hall of Famer Patrick Ewing who grew up in Cambridge, Massachusetts and attended the Cambridge Rindge and Latin School.[33] Ewing won Olympic gold medals as a member of the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men's basketball teams[34] and was selected as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996 and as one of the 75 Greatest Players in NBA History in 2021.[35] The TD Garden, above North Station, is the home to the Boston Bruins ice hockey team of the National Hockey League (NHL).

Boston was also the site of the first game of the first baseball World Series, in 1903. The Boston-New York baseball rivalry has existed since May 7, 1903: the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry, with the New York team then being known as the \"Highlanders\", from their Upper Manhattan home field location. The 1903 World Series was played between the Red Sox (then known as the \"Americans\") and the Pittsburgh Pirates,[42] while the team still played at the Huntington Avenue Grounds (the site is now a part of Northeastern University). The Sox won that series and eight more since then (1912, 1915, 1916, 1918, 2004, 2007, 2013, and 2018).

The Braves went on to sweep Connie Mack's heavily favored Athletics in four games in the 1914 World Series. The franchise is the oldest continuous professional sports franchise. The Boston Game is thought to be the origin of American football, played by New England prep schools. In 1855, manufactured inflatable balls were introduced. These were much more regular in shape than the handmade balls of earlier times, making kicking and carrying more skillful. Two competing versions had evolved during this time; the \"kicking game\" which resembled soccer and the \"running\" or \"carrying game\" which resembled rugby union. hybrid of the two, known as the \"Boston game\", was played by a group known as the Oneida Football Club. The club, considered by some historians as the first formal football club in the United States, was formed in 1861 by schoolboys who played the \"Boston game\" on Boston Common. They played mostly among themselves early on; though they organized a team of non-members to play a game in November 1863, which the Oneidas won easily. The game caught the attention of the press, and the \"Boston game\" continued to grow throughout the 1860s.[43] The first professional National Football League (NFL) franchise in the city was the Boston Bulldogs, who only played a single season (in 1929) since relocating from Pottsville, Pennsylvania."

The Boston Braves were established in 1932, under the ownership of George Preston Marshall. At the time the team played in Braves Field, home of the Boston Braves baseball team in the National League. The following year, the club moved to Fenway Park, home of the American League's Boston Red Sox, whereupon owners changed the team's name to \"Boston Redskins.\" To round out the change, Marshall hired William \"Lone Star\" Dietz, who was thought to be part Sioux, as the team's head coach. However, Boston wasn't much of a football town at the time and the team had difficulty drawing fans. In fact, the 1936 NFL Championship Game was moved to the Polo Grounds in New York City due to apathy and low support in Boston. In 1937, Marshall moved the franchise to Washington, D.C. In 1944, the Boston Yanks were established (the 3rd NFL franchise in Boston's history), playing their home games at Fenway Park and competing until 1948. The Yanks are the only officially defunct NFL team ever to have the first overall NFL draft pick. They had it twice, in 1944 and 1946. Both times they selected a quarterback from the University of Notre Dame: Angelo Bertelli (1944) and Frank Dancewicz (1946), both Massachusetts natives.

In 1959, Boston businessman Billy Sullivan was awarded a franchise in the American Football League (AFL), the Boston Patriots, bringing professional football back to Boston. Throughout the 1960s, the team lacked a permanent home field, playing at Boston University Field (at the time still known and configured as Braves Field), Fenway Park, Harvard Stadium, and Boston College's Alumni Stadium. In 1970, the AFL merged with the NFL and the Patriots joined the league (the AFL- NFL merger was announced in 1966, the first season of Super Bowl competition). The following year, the franchise was re-named the New England Patriots. From 1971 to 2002, the team played at Foxboro Stadium in the town of Foxborough, Massachusetts which is located 22 miles (45 km)[44][45] southwest of downtown Boston. Unlike most major American cities, Boston was slow to get a professional-caliber stadium, which stymied past attempts at top-tier football in the city prior to the Patriots' arrival. Largely due to the stadium issue, the Patriots are the only football team in the Boston area's sporting history to survive more than five years. The 2002 season brought the opening of Gillette Stadium, located next door to Foxboro Stadium. Businessman Robert Kraft, who at the time owned Foxboro Stadium and the team's lease for it, purchased the team in 1994 for $175 million, ensuring the Patriots would remain in New England amid a shuffle of owners and rumors of a relocation to St. Louis.

The Patriots won 21 games in a row from 2003 to 2004, including winning Super Bowl XXXVIII. The only substantive challenge to the Patriots came from the United States Football League's Boston Breakers, who played at Nickerson Field in the upstart spring league's inaugural season. However, by the end of that season, it was clear that Nickerson Field was too small and too outdated even for temporary use. Unable to find a more suitable venue, the Breakers moved to New Orleans the following season. Rugby in Boston has a strong following; the city is home to numerous amateur, college and semi-professional sides.

The Boston Storm, who began in the 2016 season, were one of the original four teams of the United Women's Lacrosse League. Two different women's soccer teams known as the Boston Breakers have been charter members of three separate professional leagues. The original version, founded in 2001, played in the short-lived Women's United Soccer Association. The Breakers were resurrected in 2009 to play in WUSA's equally short-lived successor, Women's Professional Soccer (WPS). After WPS folded following its 2011 season, the Breakers remained in operation, playing the 2012 season in the newly established semi-pro WPSL Elite. In December 2012, the Breakers were announced as one of the eight charter teams of the new National Women's Soccer League, which began play in 2013. While the WUSA and WPS Breakers played at Harvard Stadium, the NWSL team played its first season at the smaller Dilboy Stadium in Somerville.

        "text": "The Chelsea F.C.\u2013Liverpool F.C. rivalry is an inter-city rivalry between English professional football clubs Chelsea and Liverpool. Chelsea play their home games at Stamford Bridge, while Liverpool play their home games at Anfield. Though both clubs have frequently competed in the same division for over a century, the modern rivalry between Chelsea and Liverpool began in the early 2000s, when the two clubs clashed repeatedly in cup competitions, particularly in the FA Cup, the League Cup, and the UEFA Champions League. The clubs have competed in seven major cup finals: the 2005 League Cup final, which Chelsea won 3\u20132 after extra time, the 2006 Community Shield, which Liverpool won 2\u20131, the 2012 FA Cup final, which Chelsea won 2\u20131, the 2019 UEFA Super Cup, which Liverpool won 5\u20134 on penalties, the 2022 EFL Cup and FA Cup finals, both of which saw Liverpool win on penalties after two goalless affairs, and the 2024 EFL Cup final, which Liverpool won 1\u20130 after extra time. The two clubs also met in five consecutive Champions League campaigns; in the group stage of the 2005\u201306 season, where both legs finished as goalless draws, in the quarter-finals of the 2008\u201309 season, which Chelsea won 7\u20135 on aggregate, and in the semi-finals of the 2004\u201305, 2006\u201307 and 2007\u201308 seasons, with Liverpool winning the former two and Chelsea winning the latter one.[1][2] Overall, Liverpool have won more of the meetings, defeating Chelsea 87 times to their 67 wins, and a further 46 games ended in draws, as of their latest clash in October 2025. Chelsea's record win over the Reds was a 6\u20131 thrashing at Stamford Bridge in August 1937, whereas Liverpool's biggest win was a 6\u20130 home win in April 1935. In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium in Fulham with the aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham F.C. was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also considered.[3] Chelsea Football Club was founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook),[4][5] opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards. Chelsea won promotion to the First Division in their second season, and yo-yoed between the First and Second Divisions in its early years. The team reached the 1915 FA Cup final, where they lost to Sheffield United at Old Trafford, and finished third in the First Division in 1920, the club's best league campaign to that point.[6] Chelsea had a reputation for signing star players[7] and attracted large crowds. The club had the highest average attendance in English football in ten separate seasons[8] including 1907\u201308,[9] 1909\u201310,[10] 1911\u201312,[11] 1912\u201313,[12] 1913\u201314[13] and 1919\u201320.[14][15] They were FA Cup semi-finalists in 1920 and 1932, and remained in the First Division throughout the 1930s, but success eluded the club in the inter-war years. Liverpool Football Club was founded following a dispute between the Everton committee and John Houlding, club president and owner of the land at Anfield. After eight years at the stadium, Everton relocated to Goodison Park in 1892 and Houlding founded Liverpool F.C. to play at Anfield.[16] Originally named \"Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd\" (Everton Athletic for short), the club became Liverpool F.C. in March 1892 and gained official recognition three months later, after The Football Association refused to recognise the club as Everton.[17] Liverpool played their first match on 1 September 1892, a pre-season friendly match against Rotherham Town, which they won 7\u20131. The team Liverpool fielded against Rotherham was composed entirely of Scottish players\u2014the players who came from Scotland to play in England in those days were known as the Scotch Professors. Manager John McKenna had recruited the players after a scouting trip to Scotland\u2014so they became known as the \"team of Macs\".[18] The team won the Lancashire League in its debut season and joined the Football League Second Division at the start of the 1893\u201394 season. After the club was promoted to the First Division in 1896, Tom Watson was appointed manager. He led Liverpool to its first league title in 1901, before winning it again in 1906.[19] Chelsea and Liverpool were not traditional rivals, meeting first for the first time on 25 December 1907 at Anfield in the Football League First Division, which ended in a 4\u20131 win for Chelsea. However, for the next 96 years, Chelsea would only manage one single league title, which came in 1955, whereas Liverpool (who were already two-time champions) would go on to win the First Division title sixteen more times, cementing the Reds' status as one of the biggest clubs in England and in Europe, along with major rivals Manchester United, whereas Chelsea were considered to be a mid-table club, and their rivalry with Liverpool was non-existent during the years leading up to the 21st century. We were the new kids on the block who had a few quid and signed a load of players. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho puffed his chest out and then we kept playing each other. It was a clash of two ideals. \u2014\u200aFrank Lampard on Chelsea's sudden rise to success[20] The seeds of the Chelsea vs. Liverpool rivalry were beginning to be sowed in May 2003. The first major meeting that would spark this feud was on the final day of the 2002\u201303 Premier League season, where fourth-placed Chelsea were to play fifth-placed Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in a clash for UEFA Champions League football. Both teams were level on 64 points, with the Blues having a +8 superior goal difference. The three teams that were above them, Manchester United in 1st, Arsenal in 2nd and Newcastle United in 3rd had already accumulated enough points to qualify for next season's Champions League, and sixth-placed Blackburn Rovers were unable to qualify, meaning Liverpool had to defeat Chelsea otherwise they would miss out on Champions League football next season. A goal from Sami Hyypi\u00e4 in the 11th minute put the Reds 1\u20130 up, but Chelsea equalised just two minutes later through Marcel Desailly. Fourteen minutes later, Chelsea found themselves ahead via a Jesper Gr\u00f8nkj\u00e6r strike. Steven Gerrard was dismissed two minutes from full-time, as Chelsea won 2\u20131 and ensured their place in the Champions League next season, with Liverpool having to settle for UEFA Cup (now Europa League) football instead. In July 2003, long-time chairman of Chelsea Ken Bates sold the club to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich for \u00a3140,000,000. Chelsea spent \u00a3103,000,000 on transfers in the summer of 2003, which included the signings of Joe Cole from West Ham United and Hern\u00e1n Crespo from Inter Milan. Unlike the previous years, Chelsea under Abramovich had now become serious title contenders, threatening the likes of Manchester United and Arsenal, who combined had won ten of the first eleven Premier League titles. The first meeting between Chelsea and Liverpool after the Abramovich takeover was on the first matchday of the new campaign, at Anfield. Chelsea won 2\u20131, courtesy of goals from Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. Liverpool would get revenge in the reverse fixture at Stamford Bridge in January 2004, which saw Bruno Cheyrou condemn Chelsea to a 1\u20130 home defeat. However, despite the mass spend of Chelsea, they would still be unable to win the league, finishing as runners-up to the undefeated Arsenal. Meanwhile, Liverpool finished in fourth place, nineteen points behind Chelsea, but still qualifying for the Champions League. In the summer of 2004, Chelsea and Liverpool had respectively appointed managers Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Rafael Ben\u00edtez, which was the beginning of a vicious rivalry between the pair. In their first season as rivals, they clashed five times, including two Premier League victories for Mourinho, both of which finished 1\u20130 to Chelsea and both of those goals being scored by Joe Cole. In the year 2005 alone, Chelsea and Liverpool met seven times. On 27 February 2005, Liverpool faced Chelsea in the final of the Football League Cup. This was Liverpool's tenth appearance in a Football League Cup final, having won seven of them (1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1995, 2001, 2003) and losing twice (1978, 1987). For Chelsea, this was their fourth appearance in the final, winning the cup final in 1965 and 1998, and losing in 1972. Liverpool had defeated Millwall, Middlesbrough, Tottenham Hotspur and Watford en route to the final, whereas Chelsea got past West Ham United, Newcastle United, West London rivals Fulham and Manchester United. A crowd of 78,000 at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff saw John Arne Riise score a volley inside the first minute to put Liverpool ahead. The score remained 1-0 to the Reds for 79 minutes, until Steven Gerrard headed into his own net from a Chelsea free kick to give the Blues a lifeline. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was also made to watch from the stands after making a gesture to the Liverpool fans. The score was 1\u20131 at full-time, taking the game to extra-time. Goals from Didier Drogba and Mateja Ke\u017eman put Chelsea 3\u20131 up. A goal from Antonio N\u00fa\u00f1ez a minute later reduced the deficit for Liverpool, but the Blues would triumph 3\u20132 and win the League Cup for the third time. Following the match, Mourinho defended the gesture that saw him dismissed, claiming that it had been intended for the media and not Liverpool fans: \"The signal of close your mouth was not for them but for the press, they speak too much and in my opinion they try to do everything to disturb Chelsea. Wait, don't speak too soon. We lost two matches and in my opinion you (the media) try to take confidence from us and put pressure on us.\" Mourinho was happy that Chelsea had won, but said the victory was not special: \"It's just one more. I had a few before this, I'm very happy to win. It's important for the fans, for the club and especially for the players.\"[21] Just two months after the League Cup final, the two clubs met yet again in the semi-finals of the Champions League. The first leg at Stamford Bridge ended in a goalless stalemate, however, in the second leg at Anfield, Liverpool controversially won 1\u20130, thanks to a goal scored by Luis Garc\u00eda, which despite Chelsea's attempts to clear the ball off the line, the goal was given. It was dubbed as a \"ghost goal\" by Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, which popularised the term for other future incidents. This would seal Liverpool's place in the Champions League final, where they would take on AC Milan, famously coming back from 3\u20130 down and winning the Champions League on penalties. Prior to the match, Chelsea were in hot pursuit of Steven Gerrard. Liverpool had rejected a \u00a332,000,000 bid from Chelsea, however, in a shocking turn of events, Gerrard had rejected a \u00a3100,000-a-week contract offer and had submitted a transfer request, just six weeks after inspiring the comeback to help Liverpool win their fifth Champions League. He eventually changed his mind, soon after signing a new four-year deal and later stating that he would rather win one Premier League title at Liverpool than multiple at Chelsea, as it would mean more to him. Chelsea's failed signing of Liverpool's elite poster boy resulted in yet more bad blood developing between the two sets of supporters. As for the Premier League season, Chelsea were runaway winners, winning their first Premier League title (second overall), finishing twelve points clear of second-placed Arsenal. They amassed a then record-setting 95 points, also winning 29 games, a record Chelsea themselves broke in 2016-17 with 30 wins[22][circular reference] (both broken by Manchester City in 2017\u201318) and conceding 15 goals, a record that still stands to this day as the best defensive record in Premier League history. Liverpool, meanwhile, finished fifth (a regression from the previous season), behind their Merseyside derby rivals Everton, who finished fourth, and 37 points behind Chelsea. However, this also meant that despite being the winners of the 2004\u201305 Champions League, they were not guaranteed a place in next season's edition, as they had finished outside of the top four of the Premier League. On 10 June 2005, UEFA decided to grant Liverpool special dispensation to defend their title, however, they would have to enter in the first qualifying round, and were denied country protection, which meant they could face any English team at any stage of the competition.[23][24][25] Liverpool would go on to defeat The New Saints, FBK Kaunas and CSKA Sofia in the Champions League first, second and third qualifying rounds, respectively, to advance to the group stage, where they were drawn in Group G, along with Chelsea, Anderlecht, and Real Betis, although both of their matches against Chelsea were 0\u20130 draws.[26] Liverpool would finish top of the group with 12 points, with Chelsea finishing second, just behind the Reds with 11. Mourinho's Chelsea would manage to get the better of Liverpool in their Premier League clashes, defeating them 4\u20131 away at Anfield in October 2005, which made them the first Premier League opposition team to score four goals at Anfield[a] and also beating them 2\u20130 at Stamford Bridge in February 2006. However, Ben\u00edtez's Liverpool were victorious in their semi-final encounter in the FA Cup, winning 2\u20131, ending Chelsea's hopes for their first ever double and progressing to the FA Cup final, where Steven Gerrard would score an equaliser in added time to help Liverpool defeat West Ham United 3\u20131 on penalties, in what became known as The Gerrard Final. After the match, Mourinho refused to shake Ben\u00edtez's hand and claimed that the best team had lost, pointing to his side's superior league position, stating: \"Did the best team win? I don't think so. In a one-off game, maybe they will surprise me and they can do it. In the Premiership, the distance between the teams is 45 points over two seasons.\" Chelsea would win the Premier League for a second consecutive season, finishing on 91 points, whereas Liverpool, who were also title contenders throughout the season as well, finished third on 82 points, a point behind second-placed Manchester United, and 9 points behind Chelsea. As Chelsea and Liverpool were the respective winners of the 2005\u201306 Premier League and the 2005\u201306 FA Cup, this meant that they would be playing each other in the 2006 FA Community Shield on 13 August 2006, at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, the same venue that hosted the 2005 Football League Cup final a year and a half prior, which saw Chelsea beat Liverpool 3\u20132. Chelsea were also the defending champions, having beaten their London rivals Arsenal the previous year. The Blues were making their sixth appearance in the Community Shield, having previously won in 1955 and 2000, and losing in 1970 and 1997. Liverpool, on the other hand, were appearing for the 21st time, emerging outright victorious eight times (1966, 1976, 1979, 1980, 1982, 1988, 1989, 2001), sharing the shield six times (1964, 1965, 1974, 1977, 1986, 1990) and losing it six times (1922, 1971, 1983, 1984, 1992, 2002). In the match, John Arne Riise opened the scoring for Liverpool early in the first half, only for Chelsea's recently signed forward Andriy Shevchenko to equalise shortly before half-time. Both sides had chances to win the match in the second half, but a Peter Crouch goal late in the half ensured Liverpool won the match 2\u20131, and won their 15th Community Shield. The two teams were again drawn against each other in the Champions League, squaring off in the semi-finals of the competition. Chelsea would win the first leg at Stamford Bridge 1\u20130 courtesy of a goal from Joe Cole, but Liverpool won the second leg 1\u20130 as well at Anfield, with Daniel Agger ensuring the tie finished 1\u20131 on aggregate. The team that would progress was decided in a penalty shootout. Liverpool would win the penalty shootout 4\u20131, sending them to their second Champions League final in three years, which would be a rematch of the 2005 edition, which saw AC Milan get their revenge on Liverpool and defeat them 2\u20131. I'll be honest. I couldn't stand Chelsea as a club. It surpassed Everton and Manchester United as our rivalry for a period. The following season saw Jos\u00e9 Mourinho depart Chelsea in September 2007 by mutual consent, and would replaced by Avram Grant, but they would still defeat Liverpool 2\u20130 in the quarter-finals of the League Cup, with goals from Frank Lampard and Andriy Shevchenko sending the Reds crashing out of the competition. Chelsea and Liverpool were drawn against each other yet again in the semi-finals of the Champions League. In the first leg at Anfield, a Dirk Kuyt goal two minutes before half-time put Liverpool ahead, and the scoreline would remain unchanged until the 95th minute, which saw John Arne Riise scored own goal to give Chelsea an advantage, with the match finishing 1\u20131 and the Blues heading into the second leg at Stamford Bridge with a crucial away goal. Chelsea would defeat Liverpool 3\u20132, with a brace from Didier Drogba and an emotional penalty from Frank Lampard seeing Chelsea finally get the better of Liverpool in the Champions League, and sending them to their first ever Champions League final, which they would go on to lose 6\u20135 on penalties to Manchester United. On 26 October 2008, Chelsea hosted Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in the ninth gameweek of the new Premier League campaign. At this point, Chelsea were top of the Premier League, and Liverpool were second, with both teams having 20 points and Chelsea having a +9 superior goal difference. Chelsea hadn't lost a home match in the Premier League in over four and a half years, last losing at Stamford Bridge to Arsenal in February 2004, and were looking to extend their lead at the top of the table and their home unbeaten run to 87 games. In surprising fashion, however, Liverpool would defeat Chelsea 1\u20130, with a 10th-minute strike from Xabi Alonso that deflected off Chelsea defender Jos\u00e9 Bosingwa sending the Reds to the top of the Premier League and ending the Blues' record-setting 86-game home unbeaten run, their first home league defeat in over four years, which is still the record for the most home games unbeaten in the Premier League.[29] In the reverse fixture at Anfield in February 2009, Liverpool defeated Chelsea again, this time winning 2\u20130, with both goals coming from Fernando Torres late in the game. This was the first season in Premier League history that Liverpool had completed a Premier League double over Chelsea. They would also finish second, above Chelsea who finished third, making it the first Premier League season since 2001\u201302 where Liverpool finished above Chelsea in the Premier League table. In the quarter finals of the Champions League, Liverpool and Chelsea were drawn against each other again, marking the fifth consecutive season in which they played together in the Champions League, the most in Champions League history. In the first leg at Anfield, Chelsea emphatically won 3\u20131, with two goals from defender Branislav Ivanovi\u0107 and a goal from Didier Drogba giving Chelsea an advantage in the second leg at Stamford Bridge, which saw both teams play out a thrilling 4\u20134 draw, with Chelsea winning 7\u20135 on aggregate and progressing to the semi-finals of the Champions League. From 2004 to 2009, Chelsea and Liverpool met a staggering 24 times.[30][31][32] After Rafael Ben\u00edtez departed from Liverpool in June 2010, the club struggled greatly under new manager Roy Hodgson, which saw them nine out of their first twenty matches in the Premier League and sitting 12th in the table, and one of the players who struggled was elite Spanish striker Fernando Torres. Despite Torres having a successful three and a half seasons at Liverpool, which saw him score 81 goals in nearly 150 appearances, he failed to win a single trophy at the club. Chelsea had previously expressed interest in signing Torres in 2008, but Torres responded by saying it would be \"many years\" before he left Liverpool.[33][34] On 27 January 2011, Liverpool rejected a \u00a340,000,000 bid from Chelsea for Torres, which was followed by Torres handing in a transfer request the next day, which was also rejected. Chelsea finally completed the signing of Torres on 31 January 2011, for \u00a350,000,000, a then British transfer record and making Torres the sixth most expensive player in football history at the time, with the signing enraging Liverpool fans and boiling the blood in the rivalry even further. Ironically, Torres made his Chelsea debut against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on 6 February, where was he was greeted with flags and signs held up by Liverpool fans labelling him as a \"traitor\". Liverpool would go on to beat Chelsea 1\u20130, with a 69th-minute goal from Raul Meireles putting Fernando Torres' Chelsea debut in vain. The next season's edition of the Premier League saw both Chelsea and Liverpool underperform, with both teams finishing outside of the top four, which in normal circumstances would have saw them both absent from Europe entirely next season, with Chelsea, who finished sixth, qualifying for the Champions League as the Champions League winners, which also put their fierce London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, who finished fourth, in the nightmare scenario of finishing in the top four and still not qualifying for the Champions League, who had to settle for Europa League football instead. Meanwhile, Liverpool, who finished 8th, qualified for the third qualifying round of the Europa League as the runners-up of the FA Cup. However, Liverpool still managed to do a Premier League double over Chelsea, defeating them both home and away, which included a 4\u20131 humiliation at Anfield in May 2012. On 5 May 2012, Chelsea and Liverpool faced off in the final of the FA Cup for the very first time, at Wembley Stadium. Chelsea were looking to win their first trophy of the season, being managed by interim manager Roberto Di Matteo, who was prosperous about being appointed as Chelsea manager on a permanent basis. Meanwhile, Liverpool, who were being managed by club legend Kenny Dalglish, had already won the League Cup by beating Cardiff City on penalties in the final, also defeating Chelsea 2\u20130 in the fifth round en route to the final, and were aiming for a double. For Chelsea, this was their 11th appearance in a FA Cup final, having won on six occasions (1970, 1997, 2000, 2007, 2009, 2010) and lost on four occasions (1915, 1967, 1994, 2002). As for Liverpool, this was their 14th FA Cup final, winning the trophy seven times (1965, 1974, 1986, 1989, 1992, 2001, 2006) and being beaten six times (1914, 1950, 1971, 1977, 1988, 1996). On their way to the final, Chelsea defeated Portsmouth, West London rivals Queens Park Rangers, Birmingham City, Leicester City, and London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, whereas Liverpool defeated Oldham Athletic, rivals Manchester United, Brighton & Hove Albion, Stoke City, and Merseyside rivals Everton to earn their place in the final. In the match, Ramires put Chelsea in front in the 11th minute after he dispossessed Liverpool midfielder Jay Spearing and beat Pepe Reina in the Liverpool area. Chelsea extended their lead in the 52nd minute when striker Didier Drogba scored. Liverpool substitute Andy Carroll scored in the 64th minute to reduce the deficit to one goal. Carroll thought he had scored a second in the 81st minute, but his header was saved on the line by Chelsea goalkeeper Petr \u010cech. Carroll ran off celebrating, thinking he had equalised and the ball had crossed the line, but referee Phil Dowd did not award a goal (unlike the Luis Garc\u00eda \"ghost goal\" seven years prior), and Chelsea held on to win the match 2\u20131 and the FA Cup for the seventh time. On 21 April 2013, during Liverpool's 2\u20132 draw with Chelsea in a Premier League match at Anfield, Liverpool striker Luis Su\u00e1rez bit Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovi\u0107. This was not the first time that something like this had happened; it was the second time that Su\u00e1rez had bitten an opponent.[35] It was not noticed by the officials, and Su\u00e1rez scored an equalizer in injury time.[36] The bite prompted UK Prime Minister David Cameron to call on the FA to take a hard line with Su\u00e1rez: the FA charged him with violent conduct and he was fined an undisclosed sum by his club.[37] Contrary to claims from Su\u00e1rez, Ivanovi\u0107 did not accept an apology.[37] Su\u00e1rez accepted the violent conduct charge but denied the FA's claim the standard punishment of three matches was clearly insufficient for his offence.[38] A three-man independent panel appointed by the FA decided on a ten-game ban for Su\u00e1rez, who did not appeal the ban; the panel criticized Su\u00e1rez for not appreciating \"the seriousness\" of the incident when he argued against a long ban. The panel also wanted to send a \"strong message that such deplorable behaviours do not have a place in football\", while noting that \"all players in the higher level of the game are seen as role models, have the duty to act professionally and responsibly, and set the highest example of good conduct to the rest of the game \u2013 especially to young players\".[39] The 2013\u201314 Premier League season saw Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City battle it out in a four-way title race, which eventually boiled down to Chelsea, Liverpool, and City. Chelsea did the Premier League double over both Liverpool and Manchester City, but inconsistent form and losses against the low-block teams saw them fail to win the Premier League. On 27 April 2014, Liverpool, now managed by Brendan Rodgers, welcomed Chelsea, now managed by a returning Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, to Anfield. At this point, the high-flying Reds were top of the Premier League on 80 points with just three games to go, five points clear of second-placed Chelsea and six of third-placed Manchester City (who had a game in hand). They had also scored nearly a century of Premier League goals, and were on course to win their first ever Premier League title, which would have happened if they were to win their last three games, which were Chelsea at home, Crystal Palace away, and Newcastle United at home. Additionally, a win against Chelsea would have seen the Blues be unable to catch Liverpool, as they would have been eight points behind them with two games left had they have won. The match saw Steven Gerrard infamously slip while receiving a pass in first half injury-time, which allowed Demba Ba to score for Chelsea and put them 1\u20130 up at Anfield. Liverpool ultimately were unable to equalise, as a goal from Willian in the dying moments of the game saw Chelsea run out 2\u20130 winners, with Liverpool only now being two points clear of their rivals from London and three points of clear of Manchester City, who had a game in hand and had +8 superior goal difference. Liverpool followed this up by throwing away a 3\u20130 lead at Crystal Palace and only managing to come out with a 3\u20133 draw, all but confirming Manchester City's Premier League victory. The next season, Chelsea hosted Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on 10 May 2015, who at this point had been top of the Premier League for every single matchday. Liverpool provided a guard of honour for Chelsea before kick off. The match finished 1\u20131, with the goals coming from John Terry and Steven Gerrard. In the match, Gerrard, who had confirmed a few months prior that he would be departing from Liverpool at the end of the season, received a standing ovation from both the Liverpool and Chelsea fans as he was being substituted off. In a post-match interview, Gerrard had mixed feelings about being clapped off the pitch by Chelsea fans, stating: \"I was more happy with the ovation from the Liverpool fans. I think Chelsea fans have showed respect for a couple of seconds for me, but they've slaughtered me all game, so I'm not going to get drawn into wishing the Chelsea fans very well. It was nice of them to turn up for once today. But yeah, you know when you get a standing ovation at a stadium, it's nice, but what's important to me is the support from the Liverpool fans and they've been with me since day one.\" Since then, the rivalry has cooled down a little bit, though fans of both clubs still hold a dislike for each other. Liverpool, then under J\u00fcrgen Klopp, would beat Chelsea in four successive major finals during this period: the 2019 UEFA Super Cup, the 2022 EFL Cup final and the 2022 FA Cup final (all on penalties), as well as finally winning their first Premier League title in the 2019\u201320 season. The two clubs met again in the final of the 2024 EFL Cup, with Liverpool winning 1\u20130 in extra-time thanks to a header from Reds captain Virgil van Dijk.[41] Chelsea also gave Liverpool a guard of honour when the latter won the 2019\u201320 and 2024\u201325 titles. Below are the players who have played for both Chelsea and Liverpool.[42][43] In 2024, former City academy player Rio Ngumoha joined Liverpool, having never played for Chelsea's first team.",

Chelsea play their home games at Stamford Bridge, while Liverpool play their home games at Anfield. Though both clubs have frequently competed in the same division for over a century, the modern rivalry between Chelsea and Liverpool began in the early 2000s, when the two clubs clashed repeatedly in cup competitions, particularly in the FA Cup, the League Cup, and the UEFA Champions League. The clubs have competed in seven major cup finals: the 2005 League Cup final, which Chelsea won 3\u20132 after extra time, the 2006 Community Shield, which Liverpool won 2\u20131, the 2012 FA Cup final, which Chelsea won 2\u20131, the 2019 UEFA Super Cup, which Liverpool won 5\u20134 on penalties, the 2022 EFL Cup and FA Cup finals, both of which saw Liverpool win on penalties after two goalless affairs, and the 2024 EFL Cup final, which Liverpool won 1\u20130 after extra time. The two clubs also met in five consecutive Champions League campaigns; in the group stage of the 2005\u201306 season, where both legs finished as goalless draws, in the quarter-finals of the 2008\u201309 season, which Chelsea won 7\u20135 on aggregate, and in the semi-finals of the 2004\u201305, 2006\u201307 and 2007\u201308 seasons, with Liverpool winning the former two and Chelsea winning the latter one.[1][2] Overall, Liverpool have won more of the meetings, defeating Chelsea 87 times to their 67 wins, and a further 46 games ended in draws, as of their latest clash in October 2025. Chelsea's record win over the Reds was a 6\u20131 thrashing at Stamford Bridge in August 1937, whereas Liverpool's biggest win was a 6\u20130 home win in April 1935.

Chelsea's record win over the Reds was a 6\u20131 thrashing at Stamford Bridge in August 1937, whereas Liverpool's biggest win was a 6\u20130 home win in April 1935. In 1904, Gus Mears acquired the Stamford Bridge athletics stadium in Fulham with the aim of turning it into a football ground. An offer to lease it to nearby Fulham F.C. was turned down, so Mears opted to found his own club to use the stadium. As there was already a team named Fulham in the borough, the name of the adjacent borough of Chelsea was chosen for the new club; names like Kensington FC, Stamford Bridge FC and London FC were also considered.[3] Chelsea Football Club was founded on 10 March 1905 at The Rising Sun pub (now The Butcher's Hook),[4][5] opposite the present-day main entrance to the ground on Fulham Road, and were elected to the Football League shortly afterwards. Chelsea won promotion to the First Division in their second season, and yo-yoed between the First and Second Divisions in its early years. The team reached the 1915 FA Cup final, where they lost to Sheffield United at Old Trafford, and finished third in the First Division in 1920, the club's best league campaign to that point.[6] Chelsea had a reputation for signing star players[7] and attracted large crowds. The club had the highest average attendance in English football in ten separate seasons[8] including 1907\u201308,[9] 1909\u201310,[10] 1911\u201312,[11] 1912\u201313,[12] 1913\u201314[13] and 1919\u201320.[14][15] They were FA Cup semi-finalists in 1920 and 1932, and remained in the First Division throughout the 1930s, but success eluded the club in the inter-war years.

Liverpool Football Club was founded following a dispute between the Everton committee and John Houlding, club president and owner of the land at Anfield. After eight years at the stadium, Everton relocated to Goodison Park in 1892 and Houlding founded Liverpool F.C. to play at Anfield.[16] Originally named \"Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd\" (Everton Athletic for short), the club became Liverpool F.C. in March 1892 and gained official recognition three months later, after The Football Association refused to recognise the club as Everton.[17] Liverpool played their first match on 1 September 1892, a pre-season friendly match against Rotherham Town, which they won 7\u20131. The team Liverpool fielded against Rotherham was composed entirely of Scottish players\u2014the players who came from Scotland to play in England in those days were known as the Scotch Professors. Manager John McKenna had recruited the players after a scouting trip to Scotland\u2014so they became known as the \"team of Macs\".[18] The team won the Lancashire League in its debut season and joined the Football League Second Division at the start of the 1893\u201394 season. After the club was promoted to the First Division in 1896, Tom Watson was appointed manager. He led Liverpool to its first league title in 1901, before winning it again in 1906.[19] Chelsea and Liverpool were not traditional rivals, meeting first for the first time on 25 December 1907 at Anfield in the Football League First Division, which ended in a 4\u20131 win for Chelsea.

Fourteen minutes later, Chelsea found themselves ahead via a Jesper Gr\u00f8nkj\u00e6r strike. Steven Gerrard was dismissed two minutes from full-time, as Chelsea won 2\u20131 and ensured their place in the Champions League next season, with Liverpool having to settle for UEFA Cup (now Europa League) football instead. In July 2003, long-time chairman of Chelsea Ken Bates sold the club to Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich for \u00a3140,000,000. Chelsea spent \u00a3103,000,000 on transfers in the summer of 2003, which included the signings of Joe Cole from West Ham United and Hern\u00e1n Crespo from Inter Milan. Unlike the previous years, Chelsea under Abramovich had now become serious title contenders, threatening the likes of Manchester United and Arsenal, who combined had won ten of the first eleven Premier League titles. The first meeting between Chelsea and Liverpool after the Abramovich takeover was on the first matchday of the new campaign, at Anfield. Chelsea won 2\u20131, courtesy of goals from Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.

In their first season as rivals, they clashed five times, including two Premier League victories for Mourinho, both of which finished 1\u20130 to Chelsea and both of those goals being scored by Joe Cole. In the year 2005 alone, Chelsea and Liverpool met seven times. On 27 February 2005, Liverpool faced Chelsea in the final of the Football League Cup. This was Liverpool's tenth appearance in a Football League Cup final, having won seven of them (1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1995, 2001, 2003) and losing twice (1978, 1987).

Wait, don't speak too soon.

This would seal Liverpool's place in the Champions League final, where they would take on AC Milan, famously coming back from 3\u20130 down and winning the Champions League on penalties. Prior to the match, Chelsea were in hot pursuit of Steven Gerrard. Liverpool had rejected a \u00a332,000,000 bid from Chelsea, however, in a shocking turn of events, Gerrard had rejected a \u00a3100,000-a-week contract offer and had submitted a transfer request, just six weeks after inspiring the comeback to help Liverpool win their fifth Champions League. He eventually changed his mind, soon after signing a new four-year deal and later stating that he would rather win one Premier League title at Liverpool than multiple at Chelsea, as it would mean more to him. Chelsea's failed signing of Liverpool's elite poster boy resulted in yet more bad blood developing between the two sets of supporters. As for the Premier League season, Chelsea were runaway winners, winning their first Premier League title (second overall), finishing twelve points clear of second-placed Arsenal. They amassed a then record-setting 95 points, also winning 29 games, a record Chelsea themselves broke in 2016-17 with 30 wins[22][circular reference] (both broken by Manchester City in 2017\u201318) and conceding 15 goals, a record that still stands to this day as the best defensive record in Premier League history. Liverpool, meanwhile, finished fifth (a regression from the previous season), behind their Merseyside derby rivals Everton, who finished fourth, and 37 points behind Chelsea. However, this also meant that despite being the winners of the 2004\u201305 Champions League, they were not guaranteed a place in next season's edition, as they had finished outside of the top four"

On 10 June 2005, UEFA decided to grant Liverpool special dispensation to defend their title, however, they would have to enter in the first qualifying round, and were denied country protection, which meant they could face any English team at any stage of the competition.[23][24][25] Liverpool would go on to defeat The New Saints, FBK Kaunas and CSKA Sofia in the Champions League first, second and third qualifying rounds, respectively, to advance to the group stage, where they were drawn in Group G, along with Chelsea, Anderlecht, and Real Betis, although both of their matches against Chelsea were 0\u20130 draws.[26] Liverpool would finish top of the group with 12 points, with Chelsea finishing second, just behind the Reds with 11. Mourinho's Chelsea would manage to get the better of Liverpool in their Premier League clashes, defeating them 4\u20131 away at Anfield in October 2005, which made them the first Premier League opposition team to score four goals at Anfield[a] and also beating them 2\u20130 at Stamford Bridge in February 2006.

In the Premiership, the distance between the teams is 45 points over two seasons.\" Chelsea would win the Premier League for a second consecutive season, finishing on 91 points, whereas Liverpool, who were also title contenders throughout the season as well, finished third on 82 points, a point behind second-placed Manchester United, and 9 points behind Chelsea. As Chelsea and Liverpool were the respective winners of the 2005\u201306 Premier League and the 2005\u201306 FA Cup, this meant that they would be playing each other in the 2006 FA Community Shield on 13 August 2006, at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff, the same venue that hosted the 2005 Football League Cup final a year and a half prior, which saw Chelsea beat Liverpool 3\u20132.

In the match, John Arne Riise opened the scoring for Liverpool early in the first half, only for Chelsea's recently signed forward Andriy Shevchenko to equalise shortly before half-time. Both sides had chances to win the match in the second half, but a Peter Crouch goal late in the half ensured Liverpool won the match 2\u20131, and won their 15th Community Shield. The two teams were again drawn against each other in the Champions League, squaring off in the semi-finals of the competition. Chelsea would win the first leg at Stamford Bridge 1\u20130 courtesy of a goal from Joe Cole, but Liverpool won the second leg 1\u20130 as well at Anfield, with Daniel Agger ensuring the tie finished 1\u20131 on aggregate. The team that would progress was decided in a penalty shootout. Liverpool would win the penalty shootout 4\u20131, sending them to their second Champions League final in three years, which would be a rematch of the 2005 edition, which saw AC Milan get their revenge on Liverpool and defeat them 2\u20131. I'll be honest. I couldn't stand Chelsea as a club. It surpassed Everton and Manchester United as our rivalry for a period.

On 26 October 2008, Chelsea hosted Liverpool at Stamford Bridge in the ninth gameweek of the new Premier League campaign. At this point, Chelsea were top of the Premier League, and Liverpool were second, with both teams having 20 points and Chelsea having a +9 superior goal difference.

This was the first season in Premier League history that Liverpool had completed a Premier League double over Chelsea. They would also finish second, above Chelsea who finished third, making it the first Premier League season since 2001\u201302 where Liverpool finished above Chelsea in the Premier League table. In the quarter finals of the Champions League, Liverpool and Chelsea were drawn against each other again, marking the fifth consecutive season in which they played together in the Champions League, the most in Champions League history. In the first leg at Anfield, Chelsea emphatically won 3\u20131, with two goals from defender Branislav Ivanovi\u0107 and a goal from Didier Drogba giving Chelsea an advantage in the second leg at Stamford Bridge, which saw both teams play out a thrilling 4\u20134 draw, with Chelsea winning 7\u20135 on aggregate and progressing to the semi-finals of the Champions League.

Despite Torres having a successful three and a half seasons at Liverpool, which saw him score 81 goals in nearly 150 appearances, he failed to win a single trophy at the club. Chelsea had previously expressed interest in signing Torres in 2008, but Torres responded by saying it would be \"many years\" before he left Liverpool.[33][34] On 27 January 2011, Liverpool rejected a \u00a340,000,000 bid from Chelsea for Torres, which was followed by Torres handing in a transfer request the next day, which was also rejected. Chelsea finally completed the signing of Torres on 31 January 2011, for \u00a350,000,000, a then British transfer record and making Torres the sixth most expensive player in football history at the time, with the signing enraging Liverpool fans and boiling the blood in the rivalry even further. Ironically, Torres made his Chelsea debut against Liverpool at Stamford Bridge on 6 February, where was he was greeted with flags and signs held up by Liverpool fans labelling him as a \"traitor\". Liverpool would go on to beat Chelsea 1\u20130, with a 69th-minute goal from Raul Meireles putting Fernando Torres' Chelsea debut in vain.

On 5 May 2012, Chelsea and Liverpool faced off in the final of the FA Cup for the very first time, at Wembley Stadium. Chelsea were looking to win their first trophy of the season, being managed by interim manager Roberto Di Matteo, who was prosperous about being appointed as Chelsea manager on a permanent basis. Meanwhile, Liverpool, who were being managed by club legend Kenny Dalglish, had already won the League Cup by beating Cardiff City on penalties in the final, also defeating Chelsea 2\u20130 in the fifth round en route to the final, and were aiming for a double.

Chelsea extended their lead in the 52nd minute when striker Didier Drogba scored. Liverpool substitute Andy Carroll scored in the 64th minute to reduce the deficit to one goal.

The panel also wanted to send a \"strong message that such deplorable behaviours do not have a place in football\", while noting that \"all players in the higher level of the game are seen as role models, have the duty to act professionally and responsibly, and set the highest example of good conduct to the rest of the game \u2013 especially to young players\".[39] The 2013\u201314 Premier League season saw Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City battle it out in a four-way title race, which eventually boiled down to Chelsea, Liverpool, and City.

Additionally, a win against Chelsea would have seen the Blues be unable to catch Liverpool, as they would have been eight points behind them with two games left had they have won. The match saw Steven Gerrard infamously slip while receiving a pass in first half injury-time, which allowed Demba Ba to score for Chelsea and put them 1\u20130 up at Anfield.

Lim refused to return the gold chain and denied stealing it, and even threatened the two men with a knife. This sparked a fight between Lim and the two men; Soosay disarmed Lim and fatally stabbed him a few times before leaving with Kuppiah.[5] In January 1991, Singapore police arrested Kuppiah and Soosay. At the time, Soosay was also involved in the murder of Sivapragasam Subramaniam. Both Kuppiah and Soosay were charged with the murder of Lim. Kuppiah was sentenced to five years' imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane after the charge was reduced to robbery with hurt,[6] while Soosay was sentenced to death for murder.[7] After making an appeal, Soosay's charge was reduced to manslaughter and he was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment.[8][9] For his involvement in Sivapragasam's murder, Soosay was found guilty and given a second sentence of four years' imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.[10] Sagar Suppiah Retnam, the headman of Ang Soon Tong in Jurong, led 14 gang members to attack a rival gang, Gi Leng Hor, in Marsiling in December 1990. They attacked six passersby whom they thought were Gi Leng Hor members, causing the death of one Sivapragasam Subramaniam and seriously injuring the other five. Sagar was arrested in Malaysia three years later, extradited to Singapore, and charged with the murder of Sivapragasam. He was found guilty and sentenced to death by the High Court of Singapore on 31 May 1994.[11] On 7 July 1995, Sagar was hanged after losing his appeal and plea for clemency to the President of Singapore.[12] The other members of Sagar's gang were sentenced to imprisonment of between 31 months and seven years (in addition to caning for some of them) for lesser charges of rioting and inflicting grievous hurt.[13] Tan Chor Jin, nicknamed \"One-eyed Dragon\", was a member of Ang Soon Tong. On 15 February 2006, Tan used a semi-automatic Beretta 0.22 calibre pistol to kill Lim Hock Soon, a nightclub owner, in Serangoon. After the shooting, Tan fled to Malaysia and attempted to travel to Thailand before he was arrested by Malaysian police in Kuala Lumpur and extradited to Singapore. In 2007, he was convicted of murder and sentenced to death by the High Court of Singapore. He was hanged at dawn on 9 January 2009.[2][14] In December 1995, Ang Soon Tong clashed with a rival gang, See Tong, over a funeral banner. The gang members were arrested and imprisoned.[15] Leong Fook Weng, a former Ang Soon Tong member, left the gang and joined another gang, Loh Kuan. Five Ang Soon Tong members, led by one See Chee Keong, decided to punish Leong for leaving their gang and attacked him on 17 May 2000. During the attack, See fatally stabbed Leong in the chest and neck with a blade hidden in a lighter. See fled to Thailand the next day and was only arrested in Cambodia in December 2000 while attempting to smuggle illegal drugs to Malaysia. He was charged in a Cambodian court and sentenced to 18 years' imprisonment for drug trafficking. After serving 13 years in a Cambodian prison, See received a royal pardon and was released on 26 November 2013 and deported to Singapore. Two of the other men involved in the attack, Robson Tay Teik Chai and William Ho Kay Wei, were arrested and charged in court in 2003. Tay was sentenced to nine years' imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane for culpable homicide, while Ho was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for failing to report an alleged murder to the police. On 20 April 2016, See was sentenced to ten years' imprisonment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. The two other fugitives, Ong Chin Huat and Lim Hin Teck, were still on the run at the time.[16] In 2019, Julius Chen, a resident of Yishun, alleged on social media that an Ang Soon Tong member had extorted S$100 from him. Chen apparently subsequently saw the member again at a coffee shop at Block 414 on 30 March 2019, where he attempted to retrieve his money. The member responded by claiming that he was an Ang Soon Tong member and made a phone call for backup. Six Indian men allegedly later arrived at the coffee shop, threatening Chen. The police later arrived and separated Chen and the gang, giving a warning to the gang.[17][18] Ang Soon Tong attempted to control areas in Klang, a city in Malaysia, by sending parangs and katanas to gang members for them to use to assault two gardening contractors who refused to pay extortion money at a construction site in Pulau Indah on 4 September 2015. The gardening contractors were fatally injured and hospitalized. The Royal Malaysia Police later arrested 12 Ang Soon Tong members and issued a wanted notice for the local gang leader.[19]",

        "text": "Constancia Angeline Reyes Nubla (born May 27, 1954), better known by her screen name Coney Reyes, is a Filipino film and television actress, comedian, television host and producer. Reyes made her acting debut in the 1974 film Return of the Dragon. She became the primary female co-host for noontime variety shows Student Canteen (1975\u20131982) and Eat Bulaga! (1982\u20131991). This was further cemented by her eponymous Coney Reyes on Camera (1984\u20131998) which ran for fourteen years, as well as her main role in Ang Munting Paraiso (1998\u20132002).[1] After a long career in day-time television, she started to appear in primetime teleseryes in supporting roles, and even as an antagonist. In contemporary Filipino popular culture, Reyes is famous for her lead roles in family-oriented television dramas 100 Days to Heaven, Nathaniel, and My Dear Heart, as well as for her role in  Four Sisters and a Wedding. Her most recent television project was being one of the cast members of the Philippine adaptation of Shining Inheritance. Reyes earned a degree of Bachelor of Arts major in Communication Arts at Maryknoll College (now Miriam College).[2] Reyes was a student leader and consistent dean's lister during her college days.[3][4] She was a Baron Travel Girl of 1974 finalist before she entered Philippine Showbiz.[2] Before being exposed to acting, she served as a \"TV girl\" (equivalent of radio VJs) introducing shows and reading advertisements for BBC-2.[citation needed] Reyes made her first film appearance in The Return of the Dragon (1974) alongside Ramon Zamora playing the lead role. Following her debut in for films, she made her maiden appearance on Student Canteen, a Philippine noontime variety show on GMA-7, on January 6, 1975, where she served as primary female co-host with Pepe Pimentel, Eddie Ilarde and Bobby Ledesma up to 1982.[5] Nine years following her debut in The Return of the Dragon, she starred in Bago Kumalat ang Kamandag (1983) and won Best Actress during the 1983 Metro Manila Film Festival.[6] After Student Canteen, Reyes then named \"Coney Reyes-Mumar\", got her own television series to host titled Coney Reyes-Mumar Studio (1977).[5] The series only lasted one year. Four years later, Reyes was given another series \u2013 Coney Reyes Mumar on Set (1981), but like Coney Reyes-Mumar Studio, it only lasted one year before ending.[citation needed] On March 7, 1982, Coney Reyes-Mumar was unceremoniously sacked by the management of Student Canteen for reasons not widely known. Shortly after, she was offered to be Eat... Bulaga!'s new female co-host, replacing Chiqui Hollman (her counterpart in the said program), who left to join its rival show, Student Canteen.[7][better\u00a0source\u00a0needed] For two months, Reyes contemplated on joining Eat... Bulaga!. In the meantime, she did a movie with Joseph Estrada, and a week-long co-hosting stint at Daigdig ng mga Misis sa Telebisyon (BBC-2 with former Student Canteen co-host Pepe Pimentel.[citation needed] On May 18, 1982, Coney Reyes-Mumar was heralded as the newest member of the Eat... Bulaga! family, coinciding with the DOMSAT (Domestic Satellite) launch of the program in a television special at RPN-9. On that same television special, Eat... Bulaga!'s now-famous theme song debuted, with Coney being mentioned in the lyrics for being the only female co-host.[citation needed] She was warmly received by the viewers of the then-number one noontime variety show, bringing with her the sympathy of the audience due to her firing at Student Canteen.[citation needed] In 1984, Reyes starred in a lead role in Lovingly Yours: The Movie, the movie adaptation of good friend Helen Vela's Lovingly Yours, Helen, in the segment \"Akin Ang Walang Diyos\", a horror drama starring Julie Vega. Vega and Reyes starred in the segment one year before Vega's death in 1985.[citation needed] After the cancellations of Coney Reyes-Mumar Studio and Coney Reyes Mumar on Set, Reyes was given her own anthology series called Coney Reyes on Camera, rival to Lovingly Yours, Helen on GMA-7. The series ran from 1984 to 1998 making the longest running Philippine anthology television series before Maalaala Mo Kaya broke the record in 2011.[citation needed] The drama was a success and won the PMPC Star Awards for Television category for Best Drama Anthology three consecutive times. Reyes portrayed different parts in the series \u2013 host, lead star, and also producer.[citation needed] Despite the 'network drama anthology' rivalry of Reyes's Coney Reyes on Camera and Helen Vela's Lovingly Yours, Helen (which actually ran on Saturdays and Sundays, respectively), Reyes starred in an episode in Lovingly Yours in 1990 with Vela and with other close friends including Vilma Santos and Tina Revilla-Valencia. Returning the favor, Reyes starred again with friends Vilma and Tina for a tribute episode in 1994 to Helen, who died of cancer two years prior.[citation needed] In the late 1980s, rumors spread of Reyes and Eat... Bulaga! co-host Vic Sotto having a romantic relationship. By then Reyes' marriage to Larry Mumar was annulled, and Sotto having separated with his wife, Dina Bonnevie, in 1986.[citation needed] Vic and Coney's relationship, for a while, went public until Coney filed for a maternity leave at EB just after the program's move from RPN-9 to ABSCBN-2 in February 1989.[citation needed] Reyes returned to the program in time for its 10th-anniversary celebration in September that year, only three months after giving birth to son Vico.[citation needed] In December 1991, a year after becoming a born-again Christian, Reyes left Eat... Bulaga! permanently, although her name was still mentioned in the theme song until 1995.[citation needed] After Eat... Bulaga!, she focused on her weekly drama anthology, Coney Reyes on Camera.[citation needed] The program, along with other TAPE, Inc. produced shows, moved to ABS-CBN in 1989 after the government sequestration of RPN-9.[citation needed] By 1995, when TAPE, Inc. left ABS-CBN (along with Eat... Bulaga!) for GMA-7, Reyes was in charge of her show with CAN Television and Productions (derived from her real name, Constancia Angeline Nubla) along with the network's production unit, and thus Coney Reyes on Camera remained in ABS-CBN.[citation needed] On the later years of the program, she stopped acting in the show and only did the opening and closing segments.[citation needed] On December 26, 1998, Coney Reyes on Camera aired its final episode, and Coney went on a two-month hiatus.[citation needed] Months after Coney Reyes on Camera ended, Reyes returned to television by starring in Ang Munting Paraiso (1999\u20132002), a weekly family drama which ran for three years, chronicling around the life of Margarita Dionisio (Reyes) \u2013 the matriarch of the Dionisio family and the best cook in the town.[citation needed] Reyes stars with fellow veteran actor, Ronaldo Valdez as her husband, and CJ Ramos, Sarah Christophers, and Jericho Rosales as her children, respectively.[citation needed] During the run of Ang Munting Paraiso, Reyes also starred in Sa Puso Ko Iingatan Ka (2001\u201303) alongside Judy Ann Santos and Piolo Pascual portraying the mother of Patricia, played by Judy Ann Santos.[8][9] This series would be Reyes last year in a soap opera following an almost four-year hiatus from television and also films.[4][10][11] In 2004, Reyes appeared in her former daily show Eat... Bulaga!'s 25th Anniversary Special held in Expo Pilipino at Clark, Pampanga. With a special number herself and with Tito, Vic, and Joey, it was their first reunion as the memorable quartet in the program, since Coney's departure from EB more than a decade ago.[citation needed] After her four-year hiatus, Reyes reunited with her Sa Puso Ko Iingatan Ka co-star Judy Ann Santos in 2007 to star in Ysabella (2007\u201308). This series catapulted Coney Reyes as being dubbed as the Primera Kontrabida.[12] For her performance in Ysabella, she was nominated for Best Actress in the 22nd PMPC Star Awards for Television in 2008 for her portrayal as Victoria Amarillo.[10][11][12] Coney Reyes's Victoria is one of the most iconic villains in Philippine television due to her attitude, schemes, and looks.[13] Shortly after Ysabella ended, she starred in Maalaala Mo Kaya (2009) episode Tattoo alongside Rodjun Cruz, Jim Paredes, and Maureen Mauricio, and went on to star in more episodes.[citation needed] Twelve years after her reunion movie with Vic Sotto in Biyudo si Daddy, Biyuda si Mommy (1997), Reyes made her comeback to the film industry to star alongside Bea Alonzo, Derek Ramsay, and Sam Milby in And I Love You, a film revolving around three lovers.[14][15] In 2010, Reyes made another return to television in Rubi (2010), a remake of the 2004 Mexican Televisa series of the same name.[13] The series stars Jake Cuenca, Shaina Magdayao, Diether Ocampo, and Angelica Panganiban portraying the title role of Rubi, a girl who is scheming, ambitious, and cunning who has a conscience, but chooses not to listen to it to reach her dreams at the expense of others. Reyes plays the supporting role of Elisa Ferrer \u2013 Hector's (Ocampo) overprotective mother who disapproves of Rubi in being in her son's life and becoming his wife.[citation needed] After portraying several supporting roles in Sa Puso Ko Iingatan Ka, Ysabella, and Rubi, Reyes was given her first lead role since Ang Munting Paraiso. She starred in the critically acclaimed 100 Days to Heaven (2011) as Madam Anna Manalastas, a cold-hearted woman who returns to earth in her childhood form in order to correct her mistakes.[4][10][11][13] Starring with her are Jodi Sta. Maria as Sophia, Anna's (Reyes) long lost daughter, and Xyriel Manabat who portrays Young Anna Manalastas. The series received five nominations and won four of the five. Reyes and Manabat were nominated for Pop Kapamilya TV Character for their portrayal of Anna Manalastas in the ASAP Pop Viewers' Choice Awards.[citation needed] Two years after 100 Days to Heaven, Reyes made her return to primetime television in Judy Ann Santos's Huwag Ka Lang Mawawala (2013) in 2013.[16] She portrays the role of Helena Diomedes, the mother-in-law of Anessa (Santos) who completely despises her.[17][18] In 2013, Reyes co-starred in Four Sisters and a Wedding (2013) as Grace Salazar.[19] Reyes' character portrayal and lines, as well as the movie itself, has since become a part of popular Filipino culture. Four Sisters and a Wedding is Reyes's most recent film to date.[citation needed] After almost 25 years with ABS-CBN, Reyes decided to transfer to ABS-CBN's rival network GMA Network upon the invitation of Redgie Acu\u00f1a Magno, the executive vice-president for drama, coinciding with her 40th year in the industry.[4][15] With her transfer for GMA Network, she starred in Ang Dalawang Mrs. Real (2014) alongside Maricel Soriano, Lovi Poe, and Dingdong Dantes. Reyes portrayed the role of Sonia Real, the mother of Anthony Real (Dantes), a man who fell in love with two different women of two different ages and decides to marry them both. The series was nominated for Best Primetime Series for the PMPC Star Awards for TV 2014 and won two awards \u2013 one from Golden Screen TV Awards and one from US Intl Film Video Festival 2015.[citation needed] In part as a promotion for Ang Dalawang Mrs. Real, Reyes guested on Startalk, an entertainment news television series, for an emotional reunion with former EB co-host and long-time friend, Joey de Leon.[citation needed] After finishing her show on GMA Network, Reyes decided to return to ABS-CBN. Soon after her return to ABS-CBN, she was set to star in Nathaniel (2015), a fantasy television series focusing of faith and restoring goodness to humanity.[10][13] Reyes stars alongside Marco Masa, Gerald Anderson, Isabelle Daza, and also her Rubi and 100 Days to Heaven co-star Shaina Magdayao. Reyes portrays the role of AVL, a rich businesswoman who forgets her faith in God and gets followers in becoming rich and successful.[13][20] Two years later, she was then said to star in My Dear Heart (2017) with Zanjoe Marudo, Bela Padilla, Ria Atayde, and Nayomi \"Heart\" Ramos as Heart De Jesus. The series revolves around Heart De Jesus, a sick kid who becomes a spirit.[21] Reyes plays the role of Dr. Margaret Divinagracia, a rich doctor who is the biological grandmother of Heart (Ramos).[13][21][22][23] After My Dear Heart ended, she guested on Magandang Buhay (2017) with her children Vico Sotto and L.A. Mumar. During the episode, Reyes was given a special message from her children, Sotto and Mumar, respectively.[10][11] After four years with the Kapamilya network, Reyes made a comeback in GMA Network as part of Victor Magtanggol, starring Alden Richards. In 2020, she also starred in Love of My Life, playing the role of the fierce and tough mother/mother-in-law, Isabella Gonzales.[5] Reyes made a special one-day return to Eat Bulaga! during the celebration of the program's 43rd anniversary.[24] A born-again Christian since October 1990, Reyes previously co-hosted with Peter Kairuz in The 700 Club Asia which used to air on GMA News TV (now GTV, formerly QTV). She is an active member and a discipleship group leader of Victory Christian Fellowship.[25][26] She is mother to Lawrence Anthony \"L.A.\" Mumar and Carla Mumar (with former husband, former basketball player Lawrence \"Larry\" Mumar) and Pasig Mayor Vico Sotto[8][27] (with ex-boyfriend Vic Sotto).[10][11][28]",

Publishers Weekly's critic wrote: \"the novel places a comic spin on the serious subject that Davidson explored as a Fugitive poet and Agrarian essayist: how urbanization can wreak havoc on rural society and the folk arts. ... Although the novel sometimes seems dated (Danny courts Cissie by defending her honor and buying her Cokes), the colloquial speech and concert scenes ring true.\"[2] George Garrett reviewed the book: \"The Big Ballad Jamboree is a light-hearted and (in a musical sense) light-fingered book, balanced, fair-minded, accessible, and clearly intended for a popular audience.\" Garrett continued: \"Davidson clearly loved the land and the cycles and seasons of his homeplace, and that love shines through the descriptions of it.

King viewed herself as a type of representative for the region, although she herself was not in fact a Creole.[2] King also became a representative for Southern women. In her literary works, King focuses primarily on women and women's issues in Reconstruction and its aftermath. King also emphasizes how race and class affected the lives of women. Some of King's most popular stories portray white women from aristocratic families experiencing poverty and black women struggling to find their place in society. These stories show King's concern for the changing status of all women in the South following the Civil War. However, literary scholars debate over the significance of King's depiction of African-Americans. Feminist critics of the 1980s and 1990s valued King's emphasis on the experience of Southern women. Some feminist critics believed King's portrayal of black women gave them sexual independence.[3] However, some feminist scholars believe King displayed white supremacism in her fiction.[4] Other literary scholars disagree and believe that King created strong black female characters with moral agency.[5] Grace Elizabeth King was born on November 29, 1851, in New Orleans, Louisiana, to William Woodson King and Sarah Ann Miller King. King was the third of seven children. King's family had an aristocratic background.[6] Her father was a prominent lawyer, slave owner, and part owner of a sugar plantation, L'Embarrass Plantation in south central Louisiana.[7] King and her family were Scotch-Irish, but they socialized and identified with the aristocratic Creoles despite lacking Creole heritage. After Union troops invaded and occupied New Orleans in the Civil War, the King family sought refuge at L'Embarrass Plantation. King and her family remained at the plantation for the remainder of the war.[8] While living at L'Embarrass Plantation, the King children studied under their parents and maternal grandmother.[9] After the war, King returned to New Orleans with her family.[10] King also returned to school. Despite being Presbyterian, King attended French-speaking Catholic convent schools in New Orleans.[11] The King family lost most of their wealth and property in the Civil War.[12] In the following years, the Kings struggled financially and subsequently suffered from humiliation.[13] Many of the characters in King's fiction face similar situations. During her twenties, King focused primarily on her social and intellectual activities. After King finished her formal schooling, she continued to educate herself by reading books on a variety of topics. Although King had a few courtships and attempted to meet proper suitors, she never married or viewed marriage as a goal.[14] In 1884, King met Julia Ward Howe and joined her literary club, the Pan Gnostics. Each week the members met to discuss literary subjects and hear an original paper by a member. King's paper, \"Heroines of Novels\", became her first published piece. It was published in the New Orleans Times-Democrat on May 31, 1885. The article compared the various depictions of women in German, French, British, and American literature.[15] While attending the 1885 Cotton Centennial Exposition, King met the northern editor Richard Watson Gilder. The pair discussed why Creoles hated the literature of George Washington Cable, and Gilder asked King why Louisianians such as herself never tried to write their interpretation of Louisiana. The following morning King wrote her first published short story, \"Monsieur Motte.\"[16] With the help of King's friend and unofficial literary agent, Charles Dudley Warner, \"Monsieur Motte\" was published anonymously in the New Princeton Review in 1886.[17] \"Monsieur Motte\" describes the relationship between Marie Modeste, an orphaned girl about to graduate from boarding school in New Orleans and her hairdresser, Marc\u00e9lite. When the uncle paying for Marie's education never arrives to take Marie home, Marc\u00e9lite reveals that she used to be a slave for Marie's mother and feels loyal toward Marie. In order to care for Marie, Marc\u00e9lite secretly created the mythical Monsieur Motte and paid for Marie's education. King would only acknowledge her authorship of the story after its success.[18] With the encouragement of Warner, King wrote three succeeding parts and published them alongside the original story as the novel, Monsieur Motte in 1888.[17] The novel shows Marie and Marc\u00e9lite dealing with the aftermath of Marc\u00e9lite's deception. The novel also follows Marie as she enters society at a ball and meets Charles Montyon. Marie and Charles marry, with Marc\u00e9lite giving Marie away.[19] One reason King began writing and publishing was her desire to be financially independent from her brothers. After the publication of \"Monsieur Motte,\" King began writing short stories for Harper's Magazine. Many of these stories later appeared in her collections, Tales of a Time and Place. King also wrote and published the novellas \"Earthlings\" and \"The Chevalier Alain de Triton\" for literary magazines.[20] In 1893, the Century Company published another collection of King's short stories, Balcony Stories. Balcony Stories represents a shift in King's fictional writing. Her stories become much shorter, including less descriptions and simpler plots.[21] However, the stories still contained King's signature traits. The stories were told from the point of view of women who experienced the loss of social status, money, and family members due to the Civil War and Reconstruction.[22] In the 1890s, King began writing histories, focusing on colonial Louisiana.[23] King's histories were heavily influenced by her friend, Charles Gayarr\u00e9, a Louisiana historian and intellectual.[24] Gayarr\u00e9 also was a close friend of King's father.[25] King dedicated her book, New Orleans: The Place and the People (1895) to Gayarr\u00e9.[26] Scholars debate over the significance of King's histories. Some scholars find King's histories to be inconsequential due to King's focus on men.[27] Some scholars believe King's histories are important because she was the first southern women to write history of importance.[28] However, other scholars argue that King's interpretation of historical facts creates a feminized social history.[29] King's interest in and knowledge of history led to her serving as either the secretary, vice-president, and president of the Louisiana Historical Society for over thirty years.[30] On a trip to New York in 1899, King met George Brett, the president of Macmillan Publishing Company. Brett asked King to write a novel about Reconstruction in the style of Thomas Nelson Page's romantic work. King rejected the notion that anything romantic occurred during Reconstruction, but she did write a novel, The Pleasant Ways of St. Medard, based on the experience of the King family in Reconstruction. King spent years writing the book, losing most of her artistic energy in the process. The book was rejected multiple times by the Macmillan Company and other publishers. In 1916, Alfred Harcourt of Henry Holt and Company agreed to publish the novel, but it never received wide distribution or publicity. However, many critics view the novel as King's masterpiece. It tells the story of two families, white and black, in St. Medard, Louisiana. The novel follows the families through the social, economic, and psychological effects of the Civil War, including the crisis of masculinity experienced by southern patriarchs and freedmen. King also described the new roles women played after military defeat.[31] Throughout her literary career, King became friends and corresponded with many of the most notable writers and literary critics of her day. One of King's most famous friends was Samuel Clemens.[32] King felt comfortable with Clemens because of his southern upbringing, and Clemens enjoyed exchanging stories about the Mississippi River with King.[33] Through her travels, King became part of an American-French-British network composed of women. She exchanged letters with Anne Clough, Madame Blanc, Sarah Orne Jewett, and Ruth McEnery Stuart.[34] King also enjoyed friendships with Hamilton Wright Mabie, editor of Outlook and Henry Mills Alden, editor of Harper's Magazine.[35] King frequently entertained writers, editors, and professors at her home, too.[36] While King was considered a minor author, she received much recognition for her literary talents and knowledge of history. In June 1915, Tulane University awarded King with an honorary degree of doctor of letters.[37] In 1918, King received the gold palms of Officier de l'Instruction Publique from France.[38] In the last fifteen years of her life, King frequently experienced bouts of ill health.[39] By 1928, she had difficulty holding a pen and writing.[40] On January 4, 1932, King suffered a stroke, and she remained bedridden for the rest of her life. Her sisters, Nan and Nina cared for her until she died on the morning of January 14, 1932.[41] She is buried in Metairie Cemetery in New Orleans. King finished her autobiography, Memories of a Southern Woman of Letters shortly before her death. Macmillan Publishing Company published King's autobiography a few months later. In her autobiography, King offered little information about her private self. Instead, King maintained her public persona by presenting herself as a respectable southern lady.[42] Grace King High School on Grace King Place in Metairie, Louisiana, was named in her honor and held her name for decades. On April 5, 2023, the Jefferson Parish School Board, under heavy opposition from current students and alumni, voted to close Grace King and move Haynes Advanced Academy from its Old Metairie campus to Grace King's campus. Haynes Academy officially opened in its new location at the beginning of the 2023\u20132024 school year. The Residential Life Administration building at Louisiana State University is also named after her.",

This species is found in the western Indian Ocean. Johnius carutta was first formally described in 1793 by the German physician and naturalist Marcus Elieser Bloch with its type locality given as estuary of the Hooghly River near Diamond Harbour in India.[3] When he described the species Bloch created the new genus Johnius and in this species was designated as the type species of the genus in 1861 by Theodore Gill and in 1876 by Pieter Bleeker.[4] This species has been placed in the subfamily Otolithinae by some workers,[5] but the 5th edition of Fishes of the World does not recognise subfamilies within the Sciaenidae which it places in the order Acanthuriformes.[6] Johnius carutta has a specific name which is derived from Karutta Kattolei, the Malayalam name for this species.[7] Johnius carutta has a deeply incised dorsal fin, the part of the dorsal fin anterior to the incision is supported by 10 spines and the part to the rear of the incision is supported by a single spine and between 26 and 29 soft rays. The anal fin contains 2 spines and 7 soft rays. The caudal fin may have either a truncate or weak s-shaped rear margin. The standard length of the body is 2.9 to 3.8 times its depth. The teeth in the lower jaw are all the same size. The pores on the chin may be surrounded by thickened skin but this does not resemble a tag. The scales on the head and front part of the body are cycloid with ctenoid scales on the rear part of the body. The colour of the body is dull grey with irregular darker markings, like stains, on the back, there is a golden-yellow horizontal stripe along the flanks and the lateral line is silver. The belly is golden-silver and the operculum is silver. The scales have tiny black dots and darker brown edges. The first part of the dorsal fin has a black upper part while the other fins are pale marked with tiny spots.[8] This species has a maximum published total length of 30\u00a0cm (12\u00a0in) , although 20\u00a0cm (7.9\u00a0in) is more typical.[2] Johnius carutta is found in the Indian Ocean, and marginally in the Western Pacific Ocean. It extends from the Persian Gulf east to the Straits of Malacca.[1] It is a demersal fish found at depths down to 40\u00a0m (130\u00a0ft) and lives in freshwaters, brackish waters and marine areas.[2] Johnius carutta feeds on smaller fishes and invertebrates.[2] Johnius carutta is of minor importance to fisheries and the catch is sold fresh or salted.[1]",

Prior to Euro-American settlement in this area, it was occupied by the Abihka tribe of the Creek Confederacy.[4] The United States forced the Creek to agree to treaties by which they ceded their land to the US, ultimately resulting in Indian Removal to west of the Mississippi River, to Indian Territory. Talladega County was established on December 18, 1832, from land ceded by the Creek Indians near the state's geographic center.[1] The county seat was established at Talladega in 1834.[1] The name Talladega is derived from a Muscogee (Creek) Native American word Tvlvt\u0113ke, from the Muscogee etvlwa, meaning \"town\", and vt\u0113ke, or \"border\" \u2013 \"Border Town\" \u2013 a town indicating its location on the boundary between the lands of the Creek tribe and those of the Cherokee and Chickasaw.[5] According to the United States Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 760 square miles (2,000\u00a0km2), of which 737 square miles (1,910\u00a0km2) is land and 24 square miles (62\u00a0km2) (3.1%) is water.[6] It is drained by Choccolocco Creek (archaic spelling: Chockolocko) and other streams.[7] The county is located within the Coosa River Valley and the Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, with the state's highest point, Mount Cheaha, being located on its northeastern border with Cleburne County.

        "text": "Barbara Jill Walters (September 25, 1929\u00a0\u2013 December 30, 2022) was an American broadcast journalist and television personality.[1][2] Known for her interviewing ability and popularity with viewers, she appeared as a host of numerous television programs, including Today, the ABC Evening News, 20/20, and The View. Walters was a working journalist from 1951 until her retirement in 2014.[3][4][5] Walters was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1989, received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the NATAS in 2000 and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2007. Walters began her career at WNBT-TV (NBC's flagship station in New York) in 1953 as writer-producer of a news-and-information program aimed at the juvenile audience, Ask the Camera, hosted by Sandy Becker. She joined the staff of the network's Today show in the early 1960s as a writer and segment producer of women's-interest stories. Her popularity with viewers led to her receiving more airtime, and in 1974 she became co-host of the program, the first woman to hold such a position on an American news program.[6][7][8] During 1976, she continued to be a pioneer for women in broadcasting while becoming the first American female co-anchor of a network evening news program, alongside Harry Reasoner on the ABC Evening News. Walters was a correspondent, producer and co-host on the ABC news magazine 20/20 from 1979 to 2004. She became known for an annual special aired on ABC, Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People. During her career, Walters interviewed every sitting U.S. president and first lady from Richard and Pat Nixon to Barack and Michelle Obama.[9][10] She also interviewed both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, although not when either was president. She also gained acclaim and notoriety for interviewing subjects such as Fidel Castro, Anwar Sadat, Menachem Begin, Katharine Hepburn, Sean Connery, Monica Lewinsky, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Vladimir Putin,[11] Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Jiang Zemin, Saddam Hussein, and Bashar al-Assad.[12] Walters created, produced, and co-hosted the ABC daytime talk show The View; she appeared on the program from 1997 until 2014.[13] Later she continued to host several special reports for 20/20 as well as documentary series for Investigation Discovery. Her final on-air appearance for ABC News was in 2015.[14][15][16][17][18] Walters last publicly appeared in 2016. Barbara Jill Walters was born on September 25, 1929,[19][a] in Boston, a daughter of Dena (n\u00e9e Seletsky) and Lou Walters (born Louis Abraham Warmwater);[21][22] her parents were children of Russian Jewish immigrants.[23][24] Her paternal grandfather, Abraham Isaac Waremwasser, was born in the Polish city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and emigrated to England where he changed his surname to Warmwater.[25] Walters' father was born in London in 1898 and moved to New York City with his father and two brothers on August 28, 1909. His mother and four sisters arrived there the following year.[26] During Walters' childhood, her father managed the Latin Quarter nightclub in Boston, which was owned in partnership with E.\u00a0M. Loew. In 1942, her father opened the club's famous New York location. He also worked as a Broadway producer and produced the Ziegfeld Follies of 1943;[27][28] he was also the entertainment director for the Tropicana Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. He imported the Folies Berg\u00e8re stage show from Paris to the resort's main showroom.[29] Walters' older brother, Burton, was 14 months old when he died of pneumonia.[30][31] Her elder sister, Jacqueline, was born with mental disabilities and died of ovarian cancer in 1985.[32] According to Walters, her father made and lost several fortunes throughout his life in show business. He was a booking agent, and (unlike her uncles in the shoe and dress businesses) his job was not very stable. During the good times, she recalled her father taking her to the rehearsals of the nightclub shows he directed and produced. The actresses and dancers would make a huge fuss over her and twirl her around until she was dizzy, after which she said her father would take her out to get hot dogs.[33] Walters said that being surrounded by celebrities when she was young kept her from being \"in awe\" of them.[34] When she was a young woman, her father lost his night clubs and the family's penthouse on Central Park West. As Walters recalled, \"He had a breakdown. He went down to live in our house in Florida, and then the government took the house, and they took the car, and they took the furniture. [...] My mother should have married the way her friends did, to a man who was a doctor or who was in the dress business.\"[35] During her childhood in Miami Beach, she briefly lived with the mobster Bill Dwyer.[36] Walters attended Lawrence School, a public school in Brookline, Massachusetts; she left halfway through fifth grade when her father moved the family to Miami Beach in 1939.[37] She continued attending public school in Miami Beach.[38] After her father moved the family to New York City, she spent eighth grade at the private Ethical Culture Fieldston School,[39] after which the family moved back to Miami Beach.[40] She returned to New York City after tenth grade and attended Birch Wathen School, another private school.[41][42][43] In 1951, she earned a Bachelor of Arts in English from Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers, New York.[44] Walters was employed for about a year at a small advertising agency in New York City and began working at the NBC network's flagship station WNBT-TV (now WNBC), doing publicity and writing press releases. In 1953 she produced a 15-minute children's program, Ask the Camera, which was directed by Roone Arledge. She also started producing for TV host Igor Cassini (Cholly Knickerbocker), but left the network after Cassini pressured her to marry him and started a fistfight with the man she was interested in. She went to WPIX to produce the Eloise McElhone Show, which was canceled in 1954.[45] She became a writer on The Morning Show at CBS in 1955.[46] After a few years working at Tex McCrary Inc. as a publicist and as a writer at Redbook magazine, Walters joined NBC's The Today Show as a writer and researcher in 1961.[47] She moved up, becoming the show's regular \"Today Girl,\" handling lighter assignments and the weather. In her autobiography, she described this era before the Women's Movement as a time when it was believed that nobody would take a woman seriously reporting \"hard news.\" Previous \"Today Girls\" (whom Walters called \"tea pourers\") included Florence Henderson, Helen O'Connell, Estelle Parsons, and Lee Meriwether.[48][49] Within a year, she had become a reporter-at-large, developing, writing, and editing her own reports and interviews.[50] One very well-received film segment was \"A Day in the Life of a Nun.\" Another was about the daily life of a Playboy Bunny.[51] Beginning in 1971, Walters hosted her own local NBC affiliate show, Not for Women Only, which ran in the mornings after The Today Show.[52][53] Walters had a great relationship with host Hugh Downs for years. When Frank McGee was named host in 1971, he refused to do joint interviews with Walters unless he was given the first three questions.[54] She was not named co-host of the show until McGee's death in 1974 when NBC officially designated Walters as the program's first female co-host.[55] She became the first female co-host of an American news program.[56] Walters signed a five-year, $5-million contract with ABC, establishing her as the highest-paid news anchor, either male or female.[9] She and Harry Reasoner co-anchored the ABC Evening News from 1976 to 1978, making her the first American female network news anchor.[56] Reasoner had a difficult relationship with Walters because he disliked having a co-anchor, even though he worked with former CBS colleague Howard K. Smith nightly on ABC for several years. Walters said that the tension between the two was because Reasoner did not want to work with a co-anchor and also because he was unhappy at ABC, not because he disliked Walters personally.[57] In 1981, five years after the start of their short-lived ABC partnership and well after Reasoner returned to CBS News, Walters and her former co-anchor had a memorable (and cordial) 20/20 interview on the occasion of Reasoner's new book release.[58] In 1979, Walters reunited with former The Today Show host Downs as a correspondent on the ABC newsmagazine 20/20. She became Downs' co-host in 1984, and remained with the program until she retired as co-host in 2004.[59] Throughout her career at ABC, Walters appeared on ABC news specials as a commentator, including presidential inaugurations and the coverage of the September 11 attacks. She was also chosen to be the moderator for the third and final debate between candidates Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, held on the campus of the College of William and Mary at Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall in Williamsburg, Virginia, during the 1976 presidential election.[60] In 1984, she moderated a presidential debate which was held at the Dana Center for the Humanities at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire.[61] Walters was known for \"personality journalism\"[62] and her \"scoop\" interviews.[63] In 1976, she first aired her highly rated, occasional, primetime Barbara Walters Specials interview program. Her first guests included a joint appearance by President-elect Jimmy Carter and Rosalynn Carter, and a separate interview with singer-actress Barbra Streisand.[64] In November 1977, she landed the first joint interview with Egyptian president Anwar Al Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin, while they were working out the terms of the eventual Egypt\u2013Israel peace treaty.[65][66] According to The New York Times, when she competed with Walter Cronkite to interview both world leaders, at the end of Cronkite's interview, he is heard saying: \"Did Barbara get anything I didn't get?\"[67] Walters had sit-down interviews with world leaders, including the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his wife, the Empress Farah Pahlavi;[68] Russia's Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin;[69] China's Jiang Zemin; the UK's Margaret Thatcher;[70] Cuba's Fidel Castro,[71] as well as India's Indira Gandhi,[72] Czechoslovakia's V\u00e1clav Havel,[73] Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi,[74] King Hussein of Jordan,[75] King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia,[76] Venezuelan President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez,[77] Iraq's Saddam Hussein and many others. Walters interviewed other influential people including pop icon Michael Jackson, Katharine Hepburn, Vogue editor Anna Wintour,[78] and Laurence Olivier in 1980.[79] Walters considered Robert Smithdas, a deaf-blind man who spent his life improving the lives of other individuals who are deaf-blind, as her most inspirational interviewee.[80] Walters was widely lampooned for asking actress Katharine Hepburn, \"If you were a tree, what kind would you be?\" On the last 20/20 television episode in which she appears, Walters showed a video of the Hepburn interview, showing the actress saying that she felt like a strong tree in her old age. Walters followed up with the question, \"What kind of a tree?\", and Hepburn responded \"an oak\" because they do not get Dutch elm disease.[81] According to Walters, for years Hepburn refused her requests for an interview. When Hepburn finally agreed she said she wanted to meet Walters first. Walters walked affably, while Hepburn was at the top of the stairs and said, \"You're late. Have you brought me chocolates?\"[82] Walters had not, but said she never showed up without them from then on. They had several other meetings later, mostly in Hepburn's living room where she would give Walters her opinions. These included that careers and marriage did not mix, as well as her feeling that combining children with careers was out of the question. Walters said Hepburn's opinions stuck with her so much, she could repeat them almost verbatim from that point onward.[33] Her television special about Cuban leader Fidel Castro aired on ABC-TV on June 9, 1977. Although the footage of her two days of interviewing Castro in Cuba showed his personality, in part, as freewheeling, charming, and humorous,[83] she pointedly said to him, \"You allow no dissent. Your newspapers, radio, television, motion pictures are under state control.\" To this, he replied, \"Barbara, our concept of freedom of the press is not yours. If you asked us if a newspaper could appear here against socialism, I can say honestly no, it cannot appear. It would not be allowed by the party, the government, or the people. In that sense we do not have the freedom of the press that you possess in the U.S. and we are very satisfied about that.\"[84] She concluded the broadcast saying, \"What we disagreed on most profoundly is the meaning of freedom\u2014and that is what truly separates us.\"[85] At the time, Walters did not mention that she had seen New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, pitcher Whitey Ford, and several coaches in Cuba who were there to assist Cuban ballplayers.[86] On March 3, 1999, her interview with Monica Lewinsky was seen by a record 74 million viewers, the highest rating ever for a news program.[87] Walters asked Lewinsky, \"What will you tell your children when you have them?\" Lewinsky replied, \"Mommy made a big mistake,\" at which point Walters brought the program to a dramatic conclusion, turning to the camera and saying, \"that is the understatement of the year.\"[88] Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People was aired annually starting in 1993.[89] In 2000, she quizzed pop star Ricky Martin about his sexuality years before he publicly came out. The singer later said that \"he felt violated\".[90] In 2010, Walters said that she regretted having pushed him on the issue.[91] Walters was a co-host of the daytime talk show The View; for 25 years she was also a co-executive producer of BarWall Productions alongside her business partner, Bill Geddie. Geddie and Walters were co-creators of the company. The View premiered on August 11, 1997.[92] In the original opening credits Walters said the show is a forum for women of \"different generations, backgrounds, and views.\"[93] \"Be careful what you wish for...\" was part of the opening credits of its second season. On The View, she won Daytime Emmy Awards for Best Talk Show in 2003 and Best Talk Show Host (with longtime host Joy Behar, moderator Whoopi Goldberg, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, and Sherri Shepherd) in 2009.[94] Walters retired from being a co-host on May 15, 2014.[95] She returned as a guest co-host on an intermittent basis in 2014 and 2015 even in retirement. After leaving her role as 20/20 co-host in 2004, Walters remained a part-time contributor of special programming and interviews for ABC News until 2016. On March 7, 2010, Walters announced that she would no longer hold Oscar interviews but would still work for ABC and on The View.[96] On March 28, 2013, numerous media outlets reported that Walters would retire in May 2014 and that she would make the announcement on the show four days later.[97][98][99][100] However, on the April 1 episode, she neither confirmed nor denied the retirement rumors; she said \"if and when I might have an announcement to make, I will do it on this program, I promise, and the paparazzi guys\u2014you will be the last to know\".[101][102] Six weeks later Walters confirmed that she would be retiring from television hosting and interviewing, as originally reported; she made the official announcement on the May 13, 2013, episode of The View. She also announced that she would continue as the show's executive producer for as long as it \"is on the air\".[103][104][105][106][107] On June 10, 2014, it was announced she would come out of retirement for a special 20/20 interview with Peter Rodger, the father of the perpetrator of the 2014 Isla Vista killings, Elliot Rodger.[15][108] In 2015, Walters hosted special 20/20 episodes featuring interviews with Mary Kay Letourneau[14] and Donald and Melania Trump.[16] In 2015, Walters hosted the documentary series American Scandals on Investigation Discovery.[17] Walters continued to host 10 Most Fascinating People on ABC in 2014[109] and 2015.[18] Her last on-air interview was with Donald Trump for ABC News in December 2015,[110] and she made her final public appearance in 2016.[111][112] On January 1, 2023, ABC ran a special called \"Our Barbara\" and a 20/20 senior producer noted, \"For a number of years we kept her office just as is (after 2016), the papers came every day. Outside of her office she still retained her office extension.\"[113] Walters was married four times to three different men. Her first husband was Robert Henry Katz, a business executive and former Navy lieutenant. They married on June 20, 1955, at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.[1][114] The marriage was reportedly annulled after eleven months,[115] in 1957.[116] Her second husband was Lee Guber, a theatrical producer and theater owner. They married on December 8, 1963, and divorced in 1976. After Walters had three miscarriages, the couple adopted a baby girl named Jacqueline Dena Guber (born in 1968 and adopted the same year; she was named for Walters' sister).[117] Walters' third husband was Merv Adelson who at the time was the CEO of Lorimar Television. They married in 1981 and divorced in 1984. They remarried in 1986 and divorced for the second time in 1992.[118] Walters dated lawyer[119][120] Roy Cohn in college; he said that he proposed marriage to Walters the night before her wedding to Lee Guber, but Walters denied this happened.[30] She explained her lifelong devotion to Cohn as gratitude for his help in her adoption of her daughter, Jacqueline.[121] In her autobiography, Walters says she also felt grateful to Cohn because of legal assistance he had provided to her father. According to Walters, her father was the subject of an arrest warrant for \"failure to appear\" after he failed to show up for a New York court date because the family was in Las Vegas; Cohn was able to have the charge dismissed.[122] Walters testified as a character witness at Cohn's 1986 disbarment trial.[123] Walters dated future U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in the 1970s[124] and was linked romantically to United States Senator John Warner in the 1990s.[125] In Walters's autobiography Audition, she wrote that she had an affair in the 1970s with Edward Brooke, then a married United States Senator from Massachusetts. It is not clear whether Walters also was married at the time. Walters said they ended the affair to protect their careers from scandal.[126] In 2007, she dated Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning gerontologist Robert Neil Butler.[127] Walters was a close friend of Tom Brokaw, Woody Allen, Joan Rivers, and Fox News head Roger Ailes.[128] In 2013, Walters said she regretted not having more children.[129][130] In May 2010, Walters said she would be having an open-heart operation to replace a faulty aortic valve. She had known that she was suffering from aortic stenosis, even though she was symptom-free. Four days after the operation, Walters' spokeswoman, Cindi Berger, said that the procedure to fix the faulty heart valve \"went well, and the doctors are very pleased with the outcome\".[131] Walters returned to The View and her Sirius XM satellite show, Here's Barbara, in September 2010.[132][133] Walters retired permanently from both shows four years later.[134] Walters died at her home in Manhattan on December 30, 2022, at age 93. She had been suffering from dementia in her later years.[135][9][136] Her last words were, \"No regrets \u2013 I had a great life.\" Those words were etched into her gravestone at Lakeside Memorial Park, a Jewish cemetery in Doral, Florida, where Walters is buried next to her sister and parents.[137][138][139] Her parents had spent their final years in Florida, residing in Miami, with her father a resident of Douglas Gardens Jewish Home for the Aged.[140][141] Walters began her career when the prevalent view among television executives (all of whom were male) was that women reporting news about war, politics and other important matters would be taken lightly by viewers.[65] Her success is credited with creating career opportunities for future female network anchors, including Jane Pauley, Katie Couric and Diane Sawyer. Walters often got her interviewees to speak about their perspectives and share anecdotes.[9][65] She was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1989.[47] On June 15, 2007, Walters received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[142] She won Daytime and Prime Time Emmy Awards, a Women in Film Lucy Award,[143] and a GLAAD Excellence in Media award.[144] In 2008, Walters was honored with the Disney Legends award, given to those who made an outstanding contribution to The Walt Disney Company, which owns the network ABC. That same year, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the New York Women's Agenda. On September 21, 2009, Walters was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 30th Annual News and Documentary Emmy Awards at New York City's Lincoln Center.[145] Walters' status as a prominent figure in popular culture was reflected by Gilda Radner's gentle parody of her as \"Baba Wawa\" on Saturday Night Live in the late 1970s,[146] featuring Walters' distinctive speech including her rounded \"R's\". Her name appeared in the January 23, 1995, New York Times Monday Crossword Puzzle.[147] There was a social media campaign to have Barbara in Times Square to ring in 2020 by saying her iconic introduction to 20/20. As she was unable to appear CNN hired Cheri Oteri who was famous for her impression of Walters on Saturday Night Live to appear in her place.[148] Daytime Emmy Awards NAACP Image Award Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement[164] In the late 1960s, Walters wrote a magazine article, \"How to Talk to Practically Anyone About Practically Anything\", which drew upon the kinds of things people said to her, which were often mistakes.[167] Shortly after the article appeared, she received a letter from Doubleday expressing interest in expanding it into a book. Walters felt that it would help \"tongue-tied, socially awkward people\u2014the many people who worry that they can't think of the right thing to say to start a conversation.\"[167] Walters published the book How to Talk with Practically Anybody About Practically Anything in 1970, with the assistance of ghostwriter June Callwood.[168] To Walters's great surprise, the book was a success. As of 2008, it had gone through eight printings, sold hundreds of thousands of copies worldwide, and had been translated into at least six languages.[167] Walters published her autobiography, Audition: A Memoir, in 2008.[169]",

Walters was a working journalist from 1951 until her retirement in 2014.[3][4][5] Walters was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1989, received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the NATAS in 2000 and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2007. Walters began her career at WNBT-TV (NBC's flagship station in New York) in 1953 as writer-producer of a news-and-information program aimed at the juvenile audience, Ask the Camera, hosted by Sandy Becker. She joined the staff of the network's Today show in the early 1960s as a writer and segment producer of women's-interest stories. Her popularity with viewers led to her receiving more airtime, and in 1974 she became co-host of the program, the first woman to hold such a position on an American news program.[6][7][8] During 1976, she continued to be a pioneer for women in broadcasting while becoming the first American female co-anchor of a network evening news program, alongside Harry Reasoner on the ABC Evening News. Walters was a correspondent, producer and co-host on the ABC news magazine 20/20 from 1979 to 2004. She became known for an annual special aired on ABC, Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People. During her career, Walters interviewed every sitting U.S. president and first lady from Richard and Pat Nixon to Barack and Michelle Obama.[9][10] She also interviewed both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, although not when either was president. She also gained acclaim and notoriety for interviewing subjects such as Fidel Castro, Anwar Sadat, Menachem Begin, Katharine Hepburn, Sean Connery,"

Her final on-air appearance for ABC News was in 2015.[14][15][16][17][18] Walters last publicly appeared in 2016. Barbara Jill Walters was born on September 25, 1929,[19][a] in Boston, a daughter of Dena (n\u00e9e Seletsky) and Lou Walters (born Louis Abraham Warmwater);[21][22] her parents were children of Russian Jewish immigrants.[23][24] Her paternal grandfather, Abraham Isaac Waremwasser, was born in the Polish city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and emigrated to England where he changed his surname to Warmwater.[25] Walters' father was born in London in 1898 and moved to New York City with his father and two brothers on August 28, 1909. His mother and four sisters arrived there the following year.[26] During Walters' childhood, her father managed the Latin Quarter nightclub in Boston, which was owned in partnership with E. M. Loew. In 1942, her father opened the club's famous New York location. He also worked as a Broadway producer and produced the Ziegfeld Follies of 1943;[27][28] he was also the entertainment director for the Tropicana Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.

He was a booking agent, and (unlike her uncles in the shoe and dress businesses) his job was not very stable. During the good times, she recalled her father taking her to the rehearsals of the nightclub shows he directed and produced. The actresses and dancers would make a huge fuss over her and twirl her around until she was dizzy, after which she said her father would take her out to get hot dogs.[33] Walters said that being surrounded by celebrities when she was young kept her from being \"in awe\" of them.[34] When she was a young woman, her father lost his night clubs and the family's penthouse on Central Park West. As Walters recalled, \"He had a breakdown. He went down to live in our house in Florida, and then the government took the house, and they took the car, and they took the furniture. [...] My mother should have married the way her friends did, to a man who was a doctor or who was in the dress business.\"[35] During her childhood in Miami Beach, she briefly lived with the mobster Bill Dwyer.[36] Walters attended Lawrence School, a public school in Brookline, Massachusetts; she left halfway through fifth grade when her father moved the family to Miami Beach in 1939.[37] She continued attending"

In 1953 she produced a 15-minute children's program, Ask the Camera, which was directed by Roone Arledge. She also started producing for TV host Igor Cassini (Cholly Knickerbocker), but left the network after Cassini pressured her to marry him and started a fistfight with the man she was interested in. She went to WPIX to produce the Eloise McElhone Show, which was canceled in 1954.[45] She became a writer on The Morning Show at CBS in 1955.[46] After a few years working at Tex McCrary Inc. as a publicist and as a writer at Redbook magazine, Walters joined NBC's The Today Show as a writer and researcher in 1961.[47] She moved up, becoming the show's regular \"Today Girl,\" handling lighter assignments and the weather.

When Frank McGee was named host in 1971, he refused to do joint interviews with Walters unless he was given the first three questions.[54] She was not named co-host of the show until McGee's death in 1974 when NBC officially designated Walters as the program's first female co-host.[55] She became the first female co-host of an American news program.[56] Walters signed a five-year, $5-million contract with ABC, establishing her as the highest-paid news anchor, either male or female.[9] She and Harry Reasoner co-anchored the ABC Evening News from 1976 to 1978, making her the first American female network news anchor.[56] Reasoner had a difficult relationship with Walters because he disliked having a co-anchor, even though he worked with former CBS colleague Howard K.

She became Downs' co-host in 1984, and remained with the program until she retired as co-host in 2004.[59] Throughout her career at ABC, Walters appeared on ABC news specials as a commentator, including presidential inaugurations and the coverage of the September 11 attacks.

Outside of her office she still retained her office extension.\"[113] Walters was married four times to three different men. Her first husband was Robert Henry Katz, a business executive and former Navy lieutenant. They married on June 20, 1955, at the Plaza Hotel in New York City.[1][114] The marriage was reportedly annulled after eleven months,[115] in 1957.[116] Her second husband was Lee Guber, a theatrical producer and theater owner. They married on December 8, 1963, and divorced in 1976. After Walters had three miscarriages, the couple adopted a baby girl named Jacqueline Dena Guber (born in 1968 and adopted the same year; she was named for Walters' sister).[117] Walters' third husband was Merv Adelson who at the time was the CEO of Lorimar Television.

They married in 1981 and divorced in 1984. They remarried in 1986 and divorced for the second time in 1992.[118] Walters dated lawyer[119][120] Roy Cohn in college; he said that he proposed marriage to Walters the night before her wedding to Lee Guber, but Walters denied this happened.[30] She explained her lifelong devotion to Cohn as gratitude for his help in her adoption of her daughter, Jacqueline.[121] In her autobiography, Walters says she also felt grateful to Cohn because of legal assistance he had provided to her father. According to Walters, her father was the subject of an arrest warrant for \"failure to appear\" after he failed to show up for a New York court date because the family was in Las Vegas; Cohn was able to have the charge dismissed.[122] Walters testified as a character witness at Cohn's 1986 disbarment trial.[123] Walters dated future U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in the 1970s[124] and was linked romantically to United States Senator John Warner in the 1990s.[125] In Walters's autobiography Audition, she wrote that she had an affair in the 1970s with Edward Brooke, then a married United States Senator from Massachusetts. It is not clear whether Walters also was married at the time. Walters said they ended the affair to protect their careers from scandal.[126] In 2007, she dated Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning gerontologist Robert Neil Butler.[127] Walters was a close friend of Tom Brokaw, Woody Allen, Joan Rivers, and Fox News head Roger Ailes.[128] In 2013, Walters said she regretted not having more children.[129][130] In May 2010, Walters said she"

She had known that she was suffering from aortic stenosis, even though she was symptom-free. Four days after the operation, Walters' spokeswoman, Cindi Berger, said that the procedure to fix the faulty heart valve \"went well, and the doctors are very pleased with the outcome\".[131] Walters returned to The View and her Sirius XM satellite show, Here's Barbara, in September 2010.[132][133] Walters retired permanently from both shows four years later.[134] Walters died at her home in Manhattan on December 30, 2022, at age 93. She had been suffering from dementia in her later years.[135][9][136] Her last words were, \"No regrets \u2013 I had a great life.\" Those words were etched into her gravestone at Lakeside Memorial Park, a Jewish cemetery in Doral, Florida, where Walters is buried next to her sister and parents.[137][138][139] Her parents had spent their final years in Florida, residing in Miami, with her father a resident of Douglas Gardens Jewish Home for the Aged.[140][141] Walters began her career when the prevalent view among television executives (all of whom were male) was that women reporting news about war, politics and other important matters would be taken lightly by viewers.[65] Her success is credited with creating career opportunities for future female network anchors, including Jane Pauley, Katie Couric and Diane Sawyer.

That same year, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the New York Women's Agenda. On September 21, 2009, Walters was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 30th Annual News and Documentary Emmy Awards at New York City's Lincoln Center.[145] Walters' status as a prominent figure in popular culture was reflected by Gilda Radner's gentle parody of her as \"Baba Wawa\" on Saturday Night Live in the late 1970s,[146] featuring Walters' distinctive speech including her rounded \"R's\". Her name appeared in the January 23, 1995, New York Times Monday Crossword Puzzle.[147] There was a social media campaign to have Barbara in Times Square to ring in 2020 by saying her iconic introduction to 20/20. As she was unable to appear CNN hired Cheri Oteri who was famous for her impression of Walters on Saturday Night Live to appear in her place.[148] Daytime Emmy Awards NAACP Image Award Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Awards Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement[164] In the late 1960s, Walters wrote a magazine article, \"How to Talk to Practically Anyone About Practically Anything\", which drew upon the kinds"

Walters felt that it would help \"tongue-tied, socially awkward people\u2014the many people who worry that they can't think of the right thing to say to start a conversation.\"[167] Walters published the book How to Talk with Practically Anybody About Practically Anything in 1970, with the assistance of ghostwriter June Callwood.[168] To Walters's great surprise, the book was a success. As of 2008, it had gone through eight printings, sold hundreds of thousands of copies worldwide, and had been translated into at least six languages.[167] Walters published her autobiography, Audition: A Memoir, in 2008.[169]"

        "text": "The Braddock Road was a military road built in 1755 in what was then British America and is now the United States.  It was the first improved road to cross the barrier of the successive ridgelines of the Appalachian Mountains. It was constructed by troops of Virginia militia and British regulars commanded by General Edward Braddock of the Coldstream Guards, part of an expedition to conquer the Ohio Country from the French at the beginning of the French and Indian War, the North American portion of the Seven Years' War. George Washington was an aide-de-camp to General Braddock (one of his favorites) who accompanied the expedition. The expedition gave him his first field military experience along with other American military officers. A number of these men would profit from this experience during the Revolutionary War. In 1755, Braddock was sent to remove the French from Fort Duquesne (Pittsburgh).[1] Starting from Fort Cumberland, General Braddock ordered 600 men, commanded by Major Chapman and John St. Clair to cut a military road over Haystack Mountain. The road followed an Indian path known as Nemacolin's path[2] which George Washington and Christopher Gist had improved for the Ohio Company. Chapman\u2019s task was to build the road to Little Meadows, about 20 miles away. After a day of road-building, Maj. Chapman's men had only built two miles of road and had destroyed three wagons trying to get over the treacherous terrain encountered on the mountain. Braddock was about to dispatch 300 more men to the road crew when Lt. Spendlow informed him of the Navy detachment of an easier route through the Narrows. Braddock took approximately 1400 men, with accompanying wagons, along Spendlow's route and joined Chapman's road at Spendlow's Camp, in today's LaVale, Maryland. Braddock met defeat east of Fort Duquesne and was fatally wounded.[1] He was buried in the middle of the road he built, and his soldiers marched over the grave, with the hope of concealing the grave's location from the Indians. The grave was found years later by road workers, and the grave was moved. The site is now marked by a marble monument erected in 1913. The Forbes Expedition, a more successful British expedition mounted against Fort Duquesne in 1758, used a different route through the mountains west of Carlisle, Pennsylvania along what became known as Forbes' Road. The Cumberland Road, which subsequently became part of the National Road and later U.S. Route 40, roughly parallel Braddock's Road between Cumberland, Maryland, and Chestnut Ridge near Uniontown. In August 1908 and again during June and July 1909, John Kennedy Lacock, a Harvard professor originally from Amity, in Washington County, Pennsylvania, was able to identify the path of Braddock's march.  He hired Ernest K. Weller to photograph the road. Lacock's commissioned photographs survive in the form of postcards, which he published in 1910, and his written account was published in the Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography in 1914. The road Lacock discovered was a road made by over 30 years of colonial settlers following Braddock's trail.",

        "text": "Ukraine was represented at the Eurovision Song Contest 2017 with the song \"Time\" written by Yevhen Halych and Yevhen Kamenchuk. The song was performed by the band O.Torvald. In addition to participating in the contest, the Ukrainian broadcaster National Television Company of Ukraine (NTU) also hosted the Eurovision Song Contest after winning the competition in 2016 with the song \"1944\" performed by Jamala. NTU organised a national final in collaboration with commercial broadcaster STB in order to select the Ukrainian entry for the 2017 contest in Kyiv. The national selection consisted of three semi-finals, held on 4, 11 and 18 February 2017, and a final, held on 25 February 2017; eight entries competed in each semi-final with the top two from each semi-final advancing to the final. In the final, \"Time\" performed by O.Torvald was selected as the winner following the combination of votes from a three-member jury panel and a public televote. As the host country, Ukraine qualified to compete directly in the final of the Eurovision Song Contest. Ukraine's running order position was determined by draw. Performing in position 22 during the final, Ukraine placed twenty-fourth out of the 26 participating countries with 36 points. Prior to the 2017 contest, Ukraine had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest fourteen times since its first entry in 2003, winning it in 2004 with the song \"Wild Dances\" performed by Ruslana and in 2016 with the song \"1944\" performed by Jamala.[1] Following the introduction of semi-finals for the 2004 contest, Ukraine had managed to qualify to final in every contest they participated in thus far. Ukraine had been the runner-up in the contest on two occasions: in 2007 with the song \"Dancing Lasha Tumbai\" performed by Verka Serduchka and in 2008 with the song \"Shady Lady\" performed by Ani Lorak. Ukraine's least successful result had been 19th place, which they achieved during the 2005, with the song \"Razom nas bahato\" performed by GreenJolly. The Ukrainian national broadcaster, National Television Company of Ukraine (NTU), broadcasts the event within Ukraine and organises the selection process for the nation's entry. In the past, UA:PBC had alternated between both internal selections and national finals in order to select the Ukrainian entry. Between 2011 and 2014, NTU had set up national finals with several artists to choose both the song and performer to compete at Eurovision for Ukraine, with both the public and a panel of jury members involved in the selection. In September 2014, the Ukrainian broadcaster announced that the country would not participate in the 2015 because of the unstable financial and political situation caused by the war in east Ukraine.[2][3] Along with the announcement of their withdrawal, NTU revealed that it had discussed the matter with the organising body of the contest, the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), and that their absence would be limited to one year only with an expected return in 2016.[3] In 2016, NTU in collaboration with the commercial broadcaster STB had set up a national final with several artists and shows to choose both the song and performer to compete at Eurovision for Ukraine, with both the public and a panel of jury members involved in the selection. NTU's collaboration with STB continued in 2017. Vidbir 2017 was the second edition of Vidbir which selected the Ukrainian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2017. The competition took place at the Palace of Culture \"KPI\" in Kyiv and consisted of three semi-finals held on 4, 11 and 18 February 2017 and a final on 25 February 2017. All shows in the competition were hosted by Serhiy Prytula and broadcast on both UA:Pershyi and STB as well as online via NTU's YouTube broadcasts.[4][5] The selection of the competing entries for the national final and ultimately the Ukrainian Eurovision entry took place over three stages.[6] In the first stage, artists and songwriters had the opportunity to apply for the competition either through an online submission form or by attending a scheduled audition during designated dates. Applicants also had the option of entering an online wildcard selection, the winner of which was to gain direct entry into the competition's final. However, it was later announced that the winner would compete in the competition's semi-finals instead. Twenty-four acts were selected and announced on 17 January 2017.[7] The second stage consisted of the televised semi-finals which took place on 4, 11 and 18 February 2017 with eight acts competing in each show. Two acts were selected to advance from each semi-final based on the 50/50 combination of votes from a public televote and an expert jury. Both the public televote and the expert jury assigned scores ranging from 1 (lowest) to 8 (highest) and the two entries that had the highest number of points following the combination of these scores advanced to the final. The third stage was the final, which took place on 25 February 2017 and featured the six acts that qualified from the semi-finals vying to represent Ukraine in Kyiv. The winner was selected via the 50/50 combination of votes from a public televote and an expert jury. Both the public televote and the expert jury assigned scores ranging from 1 (lowest) to 6 (highest) and the entry that had the highest number of points following the combination of these scores was declared the winner. Viewers participating in the public televote during the four live shows had the opportunity to submit a single vote per phone number for each of the participating entries via SMS or the Teleportal mobile application. In the event of a tie during the semi-finals and final, the tie was decided in favour of the entry that received the highest score from the public televote. The jury panel that voted during the four shows consisted of:[8] Artists and composers had the opportunity to submit their entries via an online submission form which accepted entries between 1 September 2016 and 15 January 2017.[6] Interested performers could also attend auditions that were held between 6 November and 11 December 2016 in the following cities and locations:[9] In addition to the online submission and auditions, artists and composers also had the option of submitting their entries for the wildcard selection at STB's official website which accepted entries between 1 September 2016 and 10 January 2017. The entries were then published online and users were able to cast one vote per day.[6] Composer and producer Konstantin Meladze was assigned as the music producer of the show and was the lead in reviewing the submissions received from the online submission and auditions, of which twenty-three entries were shortlisted to compete in the national final.[4] On 17 January 2017, the twenty-four selected competing acts, including the online wildcard winner, \"Deep Shivers\" performed by Kuznetsov, were announced.[7] The twenty-four acts were allocated to one of three semi-finals during a draw that took place on 20 January, which was hosted by Konstantin Meladze. The three semi-finals took place on 4, 11 and 18 February 2017. In each semi-final eight acts competed and the top two entries determined following the combination of votes from a public televote and an expert jury advanced to the final of the competition, while the remaining six entries were eliminated. In addition to the performances of the competing entries, guests in the first semi-final included 2017 Belarusian Eurovision entrant Naviband performing the 2017 Belarusian entry \"Historyja majho \u017eyccia\" and a Belarusian version of the Eurovision 2016 winning song \"1944\" by Jamala, and 2017 Georgian Eurovision entrant Tamara Gachechiladze performing the 2017 Georgian entry \"Keep the Faith\", while 2017 Spanish Eurovision entrant Manel Navarro performed the 2017 Spanish entry \"Do It for Your Lover\" as a guest in the second semi-final. The final took place on 25 February 2017. The six entries that qualified from the semi-finals competed. The winner, \"Time\" performed by O.Torvald, was selected through the combination of votes from a public televote and an expert jury. Ties were decided in favour of the entries that received higher scores from the public televote.[10] 193,622 votes were registered by the televote during the show. In addition to the performances of the competing entries, guests included 2017 French Eurovision entrant Alma performing the 2017 French entry \"Requiem\" and 2017 Polish Eurovision entrant Kasia Mo\u015b performing the 2017 Polish entry \"Flashlight\". O.Torvald and Tayanna were tied at 10 points each at the end of the show but since O.Torvald received a higher score from the public they were declared the winners. O.Torvald made several appearances across Europe to specifically promote \"Time\" as the Ukrainian Eurovision entry. On 2 April, O.Torvald performed during the London Eurovision Party, which was held at the Caf\u00e9 de Paris venue in London and hosted by Nicki French and Paddy O'Connell.[11] On 8 April, O.Torvald performed during the Eurovision in Concert event which was held at the Melkweg venue in Amsterdam, Netherlands and hosted by Cornald Maas and Selma Bj\u00f6rnsd\u00f3ttir.[12] All countries except the \"Big Five\" (France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom) and the host country, are required to qualify from one of two semi-finals in order to compete for the final; the top ten countries from each semi-final progress to the final. As the host country, Ukraine automatically qualified to compete in the final on 13 May 2017.[13] In addition to their participation in the final, Ukraine is also required to broadcast and vote in one of the two semi-finals. During the semi-final allocation draw on 25 January 2016, Ukraine was assigned to broadcast and vote in the second semi-final on 11 May 2017.[14][15] In Ukraine, both the semi-finals and the final were broadcast on UA:Pershyi with commentary by Tetyana Terekhova and Andriy Horodyskyi.[16] The three shows were also broadcast via radio on Radio Ukraine with commentary by Olena Zelinchenko and Roman Kolyada.[17] The Ukrainian spokesperson, who announced the top 12-point score awarded by the Ukrainian jury during the final, was 2013 Ukrainian representative Zlata Ognevich. O.Torvald took part in technical rehearsals on 5 and 7 May, followed by dress rehearsals on 10, 12 and 13 May. This included the semi-final jury show on 10 May where an extended clip of the Ukrainian performance was filmed for broadcast during the live show on 11 May and the jury final on 12 May where the professional juries of each country watched and voted on the competing entries.[18] As the host nation, Ukraine's running order position in the final was decided through a random draw that took place during the Heads of Delegation meeting in Kyiv on 14 March 2017. Ukraine was drawn to perform in position 22.[19] Following the second semi-final, the shows' producers decided upon the running order of the final rather than through another draw, so that similar songs were not placed next to each other. While Ukraine had already been drawn to perform in position 22, it was determined that Ukraine would perform following Germany and before the entry from Belgium.[20] The Ukrainian performance featured the members of O.Torvald performing on stage in a band set-up in black costumes together with a backing vocalist. The stage featured a head that transitioned from grey to blue colours, with its eyes lit up in light blue and changed to red towards the end of the performance. The LED screens displayed predominately turquoise colours that turned into black at points, accompanied by a mountainous imagery that extended upwards showing a sunrise before the conclusion of the song.[21][22] The backing vocalist that joined O.Torvald on stage was Dasha Mineyeva.[23] Ukraine placed twenty-fourth in the final, scoring 36 points: 24 points from the televoting and 12 points from the juries. Voting during the three shows involved each country awarding two sets of points from 1-8, 10 and 12: one from their professional jury and the other from televoting. Each nation's jury consisted of five music industry professionals who are citizens of the country they represent, with their names published before the contest to ensure transparency. This jury judged each entry based on: vocal capacity; the stage performance; the song's composition and originality; and the overall impression by the act. In addition, no member of a national jury was permitted to be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently. The individual rankings of each jury member as well as the nation's televoting results were released shortly after the grand final. Below is a breakdown of points awarded to Ukraine and awarded by Ukraine in the second semi-final and grand final of the contest, and the breakdown of the jury voting and televoting conducted during the two shows: The following members comprised the Ukrainian jury:[26]",

This jury judged each entry based on: vocal capacity; the stage performance; the song's composition and originality; and the overall impression by the act.

        "text": "The North Australia Railway was a 509\u00a0km (316\u00a0mi) 1,067\u00a0mm (3\u00a0ft\u00a06\u00a0in) narrow gauge railway in the Northern Territory of Australia which ran from the territory capital of Darwin, once known as Palmerston, to Birdum, just south of Larrimah. Initially its name was the Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway. The first section was opened 1889, the last in 1929. The railway closed in 1976. Between 1863 and 1911 the Northern Territory was administered by the Government of South Australia.[2]:\u200a11,\u200a174\u200a In 1883, that government instituted the Palmerston and Pine Creek Railway Act,[3] which resulted in a \u00a3959,300 contract being awarded to C. & E. Millar of Melbourne. The line reached Pine Creek in 1888 and officially opened on 30 September 1889 as the northernmost outpost of the South Australian Railways.[4] Singhalese and Indian gangs did the grubbing and earthwork and 3000 Chinese labourers laid more than a kilometre of track per day. More than 300 bridges and flood openings were built.[note 1] As a consequence of Federation, the Commonwealth (or federal) government took ownership of the railway in 1911, having undertaken to connect Darwin with Adelaide by rail \u2013 but, crucially, without the completion date being specified. Since the federal government did not yet have its own railways department, the railway was leased  back to the South Australian Government and worked as part of the South Australian railway system.[2]:\u200a174\u200a World War I intervened, although in 1917 the line was extended 90\u00a0km (56 \u00a0mi) to the northern bank of the Katherine River. By 1920, public interest in the idea of a north\u2013south transcontinental railway had taken hold. However, the legal opinion of the federal attorney-general left open an interpretation that the route could be from anywhere across South Australia's northern border. Queensland interests pressed strongly for a route from the north-east corner of the state, near Birdsville, and north into the pastoral lands of Queensland before joining the existing line at Katherine River. This would involve the Central Australia Railway taking a sharp turn to the east from its established railhead at Oodnadatta for a diversion about 600\u00a0km (370\u00a0mi) east of the initially intended route through the centre of the continent via Alice Springs. The federal government referred the matter to the parliamentary standing committee on public works to examine the whole question. At the same time, it authorised an extension of the line in the Northern Territory southwards to Mataranka. This was in keeping with a changed Commonwealth viewpoint \u2013 that the start of the transcontinental railway was to be in the Northern Territory, not South Australia. The committee's report, completed in late 1922, recommended that the Port Darwin to Katherine River railway be extended to Daly Waters and eventually be extended further south to Newcastle Waters before heading to the Queensland border, and that a light line be built from Oodnadatta to Alice Springs. Further, when the time arrived for construction of a transcontinental railway, the route that would be in the best interests of Australia should be selected. When the report had been accepted, further delays occurred and it was not until 1926 \u2013 14 years after assuming ownership \u2013 that the federal government assumed actual control of the line and named it the North Australia Railway; it also took over the Central Australia Railway.[2]:\u200a179\u2013187 In 1929, the  Commonwealth Railways extended the North Australia Railway southwards to what was to be its final terminus, Birdum, and extended the Central Australia Railway northwards to its final terminus at Alice Springs. There remained a gap of more than 800\u00a0km (500\u00a0mi) to be bridged before Australia's ambitions could be fulfilled.[2] In the early years of its operation under Commonwealth control, traffic was light, which, given its light engineering, was for the best. In 1930, a mixed (i.e., freight and passenger) train, which Territorians had nicknamed Leaping Lena,[5] ran to an established timetable: The leisurely pace was to vanish in 1942. On the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Australian Army surveyed a rail route for the gap between Birdum and Alice Springs, on which freight had to be carried by road vehicles, but a line was not constructed.[6][7] \nThe railway experienced very heavy traffic since it was a strategic route to operations north of Australia. In 1944, as many as 147 trains ran per week.[8] Larrimah, 9 kilometres (5.6 miles) kilometres north of Birdum, was used as the railhead because, unlike Birdum, it was on the Stuart Highway.[note 2] Some wartime improvements were made, however,  including new locomotive depots, expanded workshops and additional locomotive water supplies. However, personnel, locomotive power and rolling stock were in critically short supply. In desperation, the Commonwealth Railways converted cattle cars (by lining the open-planked sides and installing toilets) to transport troops northwards.[10] A private company proposed a railway from Birdum to Bourke, New South Wales in 1932.[11][12] A railway from Dajarra, Queensland to Birdum was considered in 1952-53[13] but the federal Cabinet decided not to proceed.[14] Construction of a standard gauge railway to Darwin was first seriously proposed in 1965 when construction of a new standard gauge line to Alice Springs was discussed.[15] In May 1976, the federal government ordered the closure of the entire North Australia Railway line, mainly as a result of the loss of iron ore traffic originating from the Frances Creek mine. All services ceased on 30 June. Maintenance gangs were withdrawn in December 1977. Heavy floods in 1978 destroyed parts of the railway, effectively eliminating any prospect of the railway re-opening. In 1985, some rails and steel sleepers were lifted and sent for use in Tasmania.[16] The Pine Creek railway precinct has been placed in the Northern Territory Heritage Register.[17] It is in the care of the National Trust Northern Territory,[18] as is the Katherine railway station.[19] Nearly 20 years after the line between Tarcoola and Alice Springs was opened, a consortium was formed to build a standard gauge line between Alice Springs and Darwin.[20] Construction was undertaken with amazing speed and efficiency, lasting 32 months from July 2001 to September 2003. The line broadly followed the original narrow-gauge route between Adelaide River and Emungalan but about 70\u00a0per cent of the whole route was on a new alignment.[21] Modern engineering standards, much higher than those of its 19th century predecessor, resulted in none of the infrastructure on the alignment, such as it was, being retained other than the Fergusson River bridge.[note 3][22][23] The first freight train from Adelaide reached Darwin in January 2004 and the first passenger service (The Ghan) from Adelaide to Darwin in February 2004, finally fulfilling the 121-year dream of a north\u2013south transcontinental railway. 15\u00b039\u2032S 133\u00b013\u2032E\ufeff / \ufeff15.650\u00b0S 133.217\u00b0E\ufeff / -15.650; 133.217",

        "text": "Sir Edmund Knyvet (c. 1508 \u2013 1 May 1551) was the eldest son of Thomas Knyvett (c. 1485 \u2013 1512), a distinguished courtier and sea captain, and Muriel Howard (died 1512), the daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk. Born about 1508, Edmund Knyvet was the eldest son of Thomas Knyvett (c. 1485 \u2013 1512) and Muriel Howard (died 1512), the daughter of Thomas Howard, 2nd Duke of Norfolk, by his first wife, Elizabeth Tilney. By her first marriage to John Grey, 2nd Viscount Lisle,[1] Muriel Howard had a daughter, Elizabeth Grey, Viscountess Lisle. His full siblings were Ferdinand, Henry (died c. 1546), Katherine, and Anne. Knyvet's father was slain in a naval battle near Brest on 10 August 1512, and four months later, Knyvet's mother died in childbirth in December 1512. Knyvet and his siblings were at first entrusted to the care of their paternal grandmother, Eleanor Knyvet.[2] In 1516, Knyvet's wardship was sold for \u00a3400 to his father's friend, Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, who had earlier been betrothed to Knyvet's half-sister, Elizabeth Grey. It appears that Suffolk resold the wardship to Thomas Wyndham of Felbrigg, another friend and colleague of Knyvet's father. Wyndham died in 1522 and directed his executors to sell the wardship to Anthony Wingfield.[3] Although Knyvet reached the age of majority in about 1529, he did not come into his entire inheritance at that time. Knyvet's great-grandfather, William Knyvet (died 1515), had married, as his second wife Joan Stafford, daughter of Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham,[4] and had partly disinherited Edmund Knyvet (died 1504),[5] his eldest son by his first marriage, by leaving Buckenham Castle and other properties to Edward Knyvet (died 1528), the eldest son of his second marriage.[6] Edward Knyvet died childless in 1528, and William Knyvet's lands then reverted to William Knyvet's heir, Edmund Knyvet, who had livery of his lands in 1533.[7] By 1527 Knyvet had married Anne Shelton, the daughter of John Shelton of Carrow, Norfolk, and his wife, Anne Boleyn. Knyvet's wife was a sister of Mary Shelton, and a first cousin of Queen Anne Boleyn. Sir Edmund Knyvet and Anne Shelton had two sons,[8] the elder of whom, Sir Thomas Knyvett (c. 1528 \u2013 22 September 1569), married Catherine Stanley, daughter of Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby,[9] and Margaret Barlow.[citation needed] Through his marriage, Knyvet was closely connected to the Shelton, Boleyn, and Howard families. Knyvet joined his uncle, Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, in suppressing the uprising in Yorkshire in 1536 known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. It has been suggested that Knyvet was the \"E.K.\" who contributed verses to an anthology compiled by his sister-in-law, Mary Shelton.[10] Knyvet has sometimes been confused with his uncle and namesake, Edmund Knyvet, serjeant porter to King Henry VIII, who died 1 May 1539.[11] Knyvet was knighted in 1538 or 1539 and was made sheriff of Norfolk and Suffolk in November 1539.[12] At times Knyvet's relationship with the Duke of Norfolk was strained. According to Roger Virgoe, Norfolk \"always wrote about Knyvet in terms which revealed small sympathy for his hotheaded, conceited and clever young kinsman\".[13] In 1539, Knyvet's hotheadedness led to an altercation over the election of Edmund Wyndham and Richard Southwell as knights of the shire (MP) for Norfolk, as a result of which the Duke bound both Knyvet and Southwell for \u00a32000 to keep the peace and appear in the Star Chamber. In April 1541, Knyvet struck Thomas Clere, a servant of the Duke's son and heir, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, in the King's tennis court. In accordance with a recent statute enacted to curb violence at court, Knyvet was sentenced to have his right hand struck off, a sentence he only narrowly escaped by a last-minute royal pardon. In February 1542, Knyvet was also bound for 500 marks to attend daily before the Privy Council, although for what reason is unknown. Knyvet contributed to the downfall of the Howards in 1546 and testified against Surrey at his treason trial that December. He was rewarded with a lease of the manor of Wymondham and other Howard lands.[14] He took his place on the bench as Justice of the Peace for Norfolk from 1543 to his death.[15] The fall of the Howards paved the way for Knyvet's election as a knight of the shire for Norfolk in 1547. However, according to Virgoe, he remained \"a thorn in the flesh of authority\", being bound for \u00a31000 in February 1548 to attend before the Protector Somerset and the Privy Council to answer charges which may have been related to his alleged adultery with the Countess of Sussex.[16] During Kett's Rebellion in the summer of 1549, Knyvet \"led his servants in a spirited attack against the Norfolk rebels\", was one of those sent to parley with Kett, and served under John Dudley, Earl of Warwick in the final battle at Mousehold Heath on 27 August 1549. Two years later, Knyvet died in London on 1 May 1551.[17]",

        "title": "Out of autoclave composite manufacturing",
        "text": "Out of autoclave composite manufacturing is an alternative to the traditional high pressure autoclave (industrial) curing process commonly used by the aerospace manufacturers for manufacturing composite material. Out of autoclave (OOA) is a process that achieves the same quality as an autoclave but through a different process.[1] OOA curing achieves the desired fiber content and elimination of voids by placing the layup within a closed mold and applying vacuum, pressure, and heat by means other than an autoclave. A resin transfer molding (RTM) press is the typical method of applying heat and pressure to the closed mold. There are several out of autoclave technologies in current use including RTM, same qualified resin transfer molding (SQRTM), vacuum-assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM), and balanced pressure fluid molding. The most advanced of these processes can produce high-tech net shape aircraft components. Resin transfer molding (RTM) is a method of fabricating high-tech composite structures. The RTM process is capable of consistently producing composite parts with high strength, complex geometries, tight dimensional tolerances, and part quality typically required of aerospace applications. RTM uses a closed mold commonly made of aluminum. A fiber \"layup\" such as graphite is placed into the mold. The mold is closed, sealed, heated, and placed under vacuum. Heated resin is injected into the mold to impregnate the fiber layup. Having the mold heated and under vacuum, as in vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) assists the resin flow. The mold is then held at a temperature sufficient to cure the resin. Current RTM technology produces lightweight parts with excellent mechanical properties. With these qualities, composite materials are gaining wide use in a variety of structural and non-structural applications common in aerospace and aviation. RTM is one method of fabricating these composite structures.[1][2] Same qualified resin transfer molding (SQRTM) is a closed mold composites manufacturing method similar to RTM. \"Same qualified\" refers to this method injecting the same resin as that used in the prepreg layup. The attributes of  \"same qualified\" are significant to a manufacturer because those who adopt this process need not re-qualify resin materials for their production process. What sets SQRTM apart from standard resin transfer molding is the substitution of a prepreg layup rather than a dry fiber preform.[3] SQRTM is an RTM process adapted to prepreg technology. The prepreg is placed in a closed mold and during the cure cycle, a small amount of resin is injected into the cavity through ports positioned around the part. This resin does not go into the laminate, but only presses up against the edge of the laminate in order to establish hydrostatic pressure on the prepreg, similar to the goal of autoclave curing. This pressure is similar to the autoclave, on the order of 6-7 bars (90-100 psi).  Hydrostatic pressure minimizes voids by keeping dissolved air, water and resin monomers in solution in the resin. The tool can either be self-clamped and self-heated or heated and clamped by a press. The equipment is composed of a tool, a press, an injector, and a vacuum pump.[4] The key factors in the SQRTM process include precision machined closed mold tooling, high pressure presses, a high vacuum applied to the tool interior, and precise control of heating platens, injected resin volume, heat, and pressure.[citation needed] The advantages of the SQRTM process include a high level of integration, tight tolerances and the use of qualified prepregs. Its disadvantages include higher tool costs and a lower level of flexibility to design changes.[5] Vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) differs from pre-preg processing in that fiber reinforcements and core materials are laid up on a one-sided mold and vacuum bagged. Liquid resin is introduced through ports in the mold and vacuum-drawn through the reinforcements by way of designed-in channels and infusion media that facilitate fiber wetout. Subsequent curing does not require high heat or high pressure, unlike the autoclave. The process's comparatively low-cost tooling allows inexpensive production of large, complex parts in one shot,[1] such as the tail of the Mitsubishi SpaceJet.[6] Balanced pressure molding using fluid as the heat transfer is commercially practiced as the 'quickstep' process.  This process allows for the curing, partial curing, and joining of composite materials. The process involves a fluid-filled, pressure balanced, heated floating mould technology. The heated floating mold technology used within the process works by rapidly applying  heat to the laminate which is trapped between a free floating rigid or semi-rigid mold that floats in, and is surrounded by, a heat transfer fluid (HTF). The rapid heating can lead to significantly lower resin viscosities, and this in turn allows achieving full laminate consolidation using pressures lower than those used in autoclave.   The mold and laminate become separated from the circulating HTF by a flexible membrane. The part, typically under full vacuum, is subject to pressures as high as 250kPa fluid pressure and can be rapidly heated to the desired cure temperature without risk of catastrophic exothermic reaction, as the HTF can draw excess heat as desired. The air is then removed under vacuum and the laminate is compacted and heated until the part is cured. A flexible membrane beneath the mold is bonded into a pressure chamber creating the lower half of a 'clamshell' or 'chamber' like mold set. A second flexible membrane is bonded to a second pressure chamber creating the upper half of the clamshell. These pressure chambers are clamped together during processing, permitting the laminate to be compressed while reducing stress to the mold as it is floating in a balanced pressure environment within the HTF. The process can use thermosetting, thermoplastic prepregs (pre-impregnated composite fibers), and wet resin with dry fiber to produce superior composite parts. This out of autoclave process can achieve aerospace grade void contents of less than 2%, with extremely fast cycle times, and at significantly lower pressures and lower labor costs than many alternative autoclave production systems using many typical autoclave qualified prepregs. The quickstep out of autoclave system is unique in that it uses fully immersed balanced pressure fluid curing and it allows the user to stop the composite cure reaction at any point in the cure cycle, and thus can halt processing on all or part of the laminate and either return to it at a later to complete cure or to co-cure, join and bond other composites to it to create larger parts. The use of fluid to control temperature, as opposed to the gas generally used within methods such as autoclave and oven curing equates to lower energy consumption, faster cycle times and extremely accurate part temperature control. Another out of autoclave method for achieving external compression on prepreg based composite parts is through the use of heat shrink tape. This method, however, does not achieve the high quality of RTM or autoclave processes because without the autoclave or a closed mold, the part must be cured in a non-pressurized oven. These compression tapes are typically made from polyester (PET) film. Heat shrink tape is applied to a composite part prior to the heating, or curing cycle.   When heated, the tape will shrink in the linear (machine direction).   Heat shrink tape works best on parts that are cylindrical or semi-circular in cross section, as this allows the tape to exert even compaction forces on the part surface.  Examples would be composite tubes for aerospace, wind energy, consumer sporting goods, etc.  Heat shrink tape allows these parts to be processed without the need to cure with the heat and pressure of an autoclave.",

The most advanced of these processes can produce high-tech net shape aircraft components. Resin transfer molding (RTM) is a method of fabricating high-tech composite structures. The RTM process is capable of consistently producing composite parts with high strength, complex geometries, tight dimensional tolerances, and part quality typically required of aerospace applications. RTM uses a closed mold commonly made of aluminum. A fiber \"layup\" such as graphite is placed into the mold. The mold is closed, sealed, heated, and placed under vacuum. Heated resin is injected into the mold to impregnate the fiber layup. Having the mold heated and under vacuum, as in vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) assists the resin flow. The mold is then held at a temperature sufficient to cure the resin. Current RTM technology produces lightweight parts with excellent mechanical properties. With these qualities, composite materials are gaining wide use in a variety of structural and non-structural applications common in aerospace and aviation. RTM is one method of fabricating these composite structures.[1][2] Same qualified resin transfer molding (SQRTM) is a closed"

With these qualities, composite materials are gaining wide use in a variety of structural and non-structural applications common in aerospace and aviation. RTM is one method of fabricating these composite structures.[1][2] Same qualified resin transfer molding (SQRTM) is a closed mold composites manufacturing method similar to RTM. \"Same qualified\" refers to this method injecting the same resin as that used in the prepreg layup. The attributes of \"same qualified\" are significant to a manufacturer because those who adopt this process need not re-qualify resin materials for their production process. What sets SQRTM apart from standard resin transfer molding is the substitution of a prepreg layup rather than a dry fiber preform.[3] SQRTM is an RTM process adapted to prepreg technology. The prepreg is placed in a closed mold and during the cure cycle, a small amount of resin is injected into the cavity through ports positioned around the part. This resin does not go into the laminate, but only presses up against the edge of the laminate in order to establish hydrostatic pressure on the prepreg, similar to the goal of autoclave curing. This pressure is similar to the autoclave, on the order of 6-7 bars (90-100 psi). Hydrostatic pressure minimizes voids by keeping dissolved air, water and resin monomers in solution in the resin. The tool can either be self-clamped and self-heated or heated and clamped by a press. The equipment is composed of a tool, a press, an injector, and a vacuum pump.[4] The key factors in the SQRTM process include precision machined closed mold tooling, high pressure presses, a high vacuum applied to the tool interior, and precise control of heating platens, injected resin volume, heat, and pressure.[citation needed] The advantages of the SQRTM process include a"

Its disadvantages include higher tool costs and a lower level of flexibility to design changes.[5] Vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) differs from pre-preg processing in that fiber reinforcements and core materials are laid up on a one-sided mold and vacuum bagged. Liquid resin is introduced through ports in the mold and vacuum-drawn through the reinforcements by way of designed-in channels and infusion media that facilitate fiber wetout. Subsequent curing does not require high heat or high pressure, unlike the autoclave. The process's comparatively low-cost tooling allows inexpensive production of large, complex parts in one shot,[1] such as the tail of the Mitsubishi SpaceJet.[6] Balanced pressure molding using fluid as the heat transfer is commercially practiced as the 'quickstep' process. This process allows for the curing, partial curing, and joining of composite materials. The process involves a fluid-filled, pressure balanced, heated floating mould technology. The heated floating mold technology used within the process works by rapidly applying heat to the laminate which is trapped between a free floating rigid or semi-rigid mold that floats in, and is surrounded by, a heat transfer fluid (HTF). The rapid heating can lead to significantly lower resin viscosities, and this in turn allows achieving full laminate consolidation using pressures lower than those used in autoclave. The mold and laminate become separated from the circulating HTF by a flexible membrane. The part, typically under full vacuum, is subject to pressures as high as"

The mold and laminate become separated from the circulating HTF by a flexible membrane. The part, typically under full vacuum, is subject to pressures as high as 250kPa fluid pressure and can be rapidly heated to the desired cure temperature without risk of catastrophic exothermic reaction, as the HTF can draw excess heat as desired. The air is then removed under vacuum and the laminate is compacted and heated until the part is cured. A flexible membrane beneath the mold is bonded into a pressure chamber creating the lower half of a 'clamshell' or 'chamber' like mold set. A second flexible membrane is bonded to a second pressure chamber creating the upper half of the clamshell. These pressure chambers are clamped together during processing, permitting the laminate to be compressed while reducing stress to the mold as it is floating in a balanced pressure environment within the HTF. The process can use thermosetting, thermoplastic prepregs (pre-impregnated composite fibers), and wet resin with dry fiber to produce superior composite parts. This out of autoclave process can achieve aerospace grade void contents of less than 2%, with extremely fast cycle times, and at significantly lower pressures and lower labor costs than many alternative autoclave production systems using many typical autoclave qualified prepregs. The quickstep out of autoclave system is unique in that it uses fully immersed balanced pressure fluid curing and it allows the user to stop the composite cure reaction at any point in the cure cycle, and thus can halt processing on all or part of the laminate and either return to it at a later to complete cure or to co-cure, join and bond other composites"

The use of fluid to control temperature, as opposed to the gas generally used within methods such as autoclave and oven curing equates to lower energy consumption, faster cycle times and extremely accurate part temperature control. Another out of autoclave method for achieving external compression on prepreg based composite parts is through the use of heat shrink tape. This method, however, does not achieve the high quality of RTM or autoclave processes because without the autoclave or a closed mold, the part must be cured in a non-pressurized oven. These compression tapes are typically made from polyester (PET) film. Heat shrink tape is applied to a composite part prior to the heating, or curing cycle. When heated, the tape will shrink in the linear (machine direction). Heat shrink tape works best on parts that are cylindrical or semi-circular in cross section, as this allows the tape to exert even compaction forces on the part surface. Examples would be composite tubes for aerospace, wind energy, consumer sporting goods, etc. Heat shrink tape allows these parts to be processed without the need to cure with the heat and pressure of an autoclave."

        "title": "Shane Black",
        "text": "Shane Black (born December 16, 1961) is an American screenwriter, film director, and actor, known for his distinctive style of action and action comedy films. He originated the Lethal Weapon franchise, and has also written such films as The Monster Squad (1987), The Last Boy Scout (1991), Last Action Hero (1993), and The Long Kiss Goodnight (1996). As an actor, Black is best known for his role as Hawkins in Predator (1987). He made his directorial debut with the film Kiss Kiss Bang Bang in 2005. Black went on to write and direct Iron Man 3 (2013), The Nice Guys (2016), The Predator (2018) and Play Dirty (2025). Shane Black was born on December 16, 1961[1]  in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,[2] the son of Paul and Patricia Ann Black. His father was in the printing business,[1] and helped Black develop his interest in hardboiled fiction, including the works of Mickey Spillane and the Matt Helm series.[3] He grew up in the suburbs of Lower Burrell and Mount Lebanon, Pennsylvania, and later moved to Fullerton, California, during his sophomore year of high school.[2] In Fullerton, he attended Sunny Hills High School.[4] He attended UCLA, where he majored in film and theater and graduated in 1983.[5] During his senior year, he decided to make a living in the film industry once his classmate, Fred Dekker, showed him a science fiction script he did for an assignment.[3] Black's older brother, Terry Black, who also wrote short stories,  decided to move into screenplays starting with 1988's Dead Heat, in which Shane had a cameo.[6] After graduating, Black worked as a typist for a temp agency, a data entry clerk for the 1984 Summer Olympics and an usher in a Westwood movie theater. Eventually he asked for financial support of his parents during the six-month development of a script, The Shadow Company, a supernatural thriller set in Vietnam.[3] With Dekker's help, the script landed him an agent and several meetings with mid-level studio executives. This attracted 20th Century Fox executives, who were interested in having Black rewrite scripts.[7] Eventually Black wrote an action film script, Lethal Weapon, in about six weeks, which landed him a $250,000 deal with Warner Bros. During the rewrites, Black asked producer Joel Silver for a small acting role in another film Silver was preparing at the time, Predator, a film for which Black also made uncredited contributions to the script. At the same time, Black helped Dekker write The Monster Squad, which along with Lethal Weapon and Predator came out in 1987.[3] Since then, Black has acted in five additional films and in two episodes for the TV series Dark Justice. Once Warner Bros. requested a Lethal Weapon sequel, Black wrote the first draft  of Lethal Weapon 2 with the help of novelist Warren Murphy. Although it was not used, Black said in later interviews that Warner Bros. did not like his original script for Lethal Weapon 2, which was also titled Play Dirty, because of how dark and violent it was and due to his decision to kill off main character Martin Riggs in the ending of the script. Black considers it to be his best work and the best script he has written.[8][9][10] Feeling burned out and having conflicts with the studio, Black left the project after six months, earning $125,000 out of a $250,000 payment split with Murphy, for his work.[3][7] After two sabbatical years, Black decided to take on an old idea of his that emerged during the production of Lethal Weapon and turn it into a full screenplay. The result, The Last Boy Scout, earned him $1.75 million in 1991.[7] Black earned $1 million for his rewrite of Last Action Hero in 1993.[11] He set a record by receiving $4 million for writing The Long Kiss Goodnight in 1994.[12] Black made his directorial debut with 2005's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, and later directed (and co-wrote with Drew Pearce) 2013's Iron Man 3, which as of 2024 ranks as the twenty-fifth-highest-grossing film of all time worldwide.[13] Black next directed and co-wrote Edge, a pilot for a potential series for Amazon Studios. The film was released on video on demand but not picked up for a series. He followed this with the action comedy The Nice Guys, starring Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling, and produced by Joel Silver.[14] Warner Bros. handled North American rights to the film,[15] which was released on May 20, 2016.[16] Black next directed the fourth non-Alien-related film in the Predator series, The Predator, which he co-wrote with Fred Dekker.[17][18][19] The film was released on September 14, 2018.[20] Black hired his friend Steven Wilder Striegel for a minor, un-auditioned role in The Predator (as well as, previously, Iron Man 3 and The Nice Guys). Striegel spent six months in prison in 2010, having pleaded guilty to risk of injury to a child and enticing a minor by computer after he had attempted to lure a 14-year-old girl into a sexual relationship via email. Olivia Munn, an actress in The Predator, insisted on having a scene with Striegel removed after she discovered his history.[21][22] Black initially defended his decision and his friend, but later rescinded them and released a public apology. In 2024, Black directed the film Play Dirty, an adaptation of Donald E. Westlake's Parker novel series.[23] Black's unrealized projects included an adaptation of Doc Savage[24][25] and The Destroyer, based on the series of paperback adventure novels that previously inspired the 1985 film Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins, starring Fred Ward. He was briefly attached by Warner Bros. in 2011 to direct a live-action American adaptation of the Japanese supernatural-thriller manga series Death Note, bringing his collaborators Anthony Bagarozzi and Charles Mondry to write the screenplay, replacing Charley and Vlas Parlapanides as the project's previous screenwriters. By 2014, he had left the project, due to reported creative differences and other commitments. Director Adam Wingard was eventually hired to helm the project by 2015.[citation needed] Black has a recognizable writing style characterized by stories in which two main characters become friends, problematic protagonists who become better human beings at the end of the narrative,[26] and trade witty dialogue, featuring labyrinthine crime plots, often set during Christmas time.[27] The quips he incorporates into his scripts are referred to as \"Shane Blackisms\", in which jokes about the story situations are included in the scene directions of the script.[28] He also sometimes directs comments at studio executives and script readers. Examples of these include: From Lethal Weapon: EXT. POSH BEVERLY HILLS HOME \u2013 TWILIGHT\nThe kind of house that I'll buy if this movie is a huge hit. Chrome. Glass. Carved wood. Plus an outdoor solarium: A glass structure, like a greenhouse only there's a big swimming pool inside. This is a really great place to have sex.[29] From The Last Boy Scout: Remember Jimmy's friend, Henry, who we met briefly near the opening of the film? Of course you do, you're a highly-paid reader or development person. This approach, which Black summed as \"more open to the reader\" and aimed at \"trying to keep people awake\", was described by himself as a combination of William Goldman, his mentor in screenwriting, and Walter Hill, who had a \"terse and Spartan, punchy prose\".[30] Black gave a list of techniques he uses when writing films in an interview with The Guardian.[31] Black explains that Christmas, which has been used as a backdrop in Lethal Weapon, Last Action Hero, The Long Kiss Goodnight, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Iron Man 3, The Nice Guys and Play Dirty (and in his original script for The Last Boy Scout, although references to the date have been almost entirely eliminated from the film), is a touchstone for him, explaining:[27][32][33] Christmas represents a little stutter in the march of days, a hush in which we have a chance to assess and retrospect our lives. I tend to think also that it just informs as a backdrop. The first time I noticed it was Three Days of the Condor, the Sydney Pollack film, where Christmas in the background adds this really odd, chilling counterpoint to the espionage plot. I also think that Christmas is just a thing of beauty, especially as it applies to places like Los Angeles, where it's not so obvious, and you have to dig for it, like little nuggets. One night, on Christmas Eve, I walked past a Mexican lunch wagon serving tacos, and I saw this little string, and on it was a little broken plastic figurine, with a light bulb inside it, of the Virgin Mary. And I thought, that's just a little hidden piece of magic. You know, all around the city are little slices, little icons of Christmas, that are as effective and beautiful in and of themselves as any 40-foot Christmas tree on the lawn of the White House. So that, in a lot of words, is the answer.[27] Uncredited script doctor Unproduced Black received the Distinguished Screenwriter Award from the Austin Film Festival October 21, 2006. In 2005, he received the Best Original Screenplay award for Kiss Kiss Bang Bang from the San Diego Film Critics Association.",

I tend to think also that it just informs as a backdrop. The first time I noticed it was Three Days of the Condor, the Sydney Pollack film, where Christmas in the background adds this really odd, chilling counterpoint to the espionage plot. I also think that Christmas is just a thing of beauty, especially as it applies to places like Los Angeles, where it's not so obvious, and you have to dig for it, like little nuggets. One night, on Christmas Eve, I walked past a Mexican lunch wagon serving tacos, and I saw this little string, and on it was a little broken plastic figurine, with a light bulb inside it, of the Virgin Mary. And I thought, that's just a little hidden piece of magic. You know, all around the city are little slices, little icons of Christmas, that are as effective and beautiful in and of themselves as any 40-foot Christmas tree on the lawn of the White House. So that, in a lot of words, is the answer.[27] Uncredited script doctor Unproduced Black received the Distinguished Screenwriter Award from the Austin Film Festival October 21, 2006.

Zhang Lu started his football career with Liaoning Whowin in 2005 after graduating from their youth team. Despite his age, he had quickly established himself within the Liaoning squad in his debut season. However while he had firmly established himself as the first choice goalkeeper, by the 2008 league season, he saw them relegated to the second tier.[1] Despite this setback, Zhang remained with Liaoning and helped the team win the second division title as well as promotion back to the top tier after only one season. On 12 January 2016, Zhang transferred to his hometown club Tianjin Quanjian in the China League One.[2] In his first season with the club he would go on to establish himself as their first-choice goalkeeper and win the division title along with promotion to the Chinese Super League.[3] He would establish himself as a vital member of the team and aided them to their highest ever position of third and qualification to the AFC Champions League for the first time in their history.[4] On 18 September 2019, Zhang has inspected by Traffic Police.

Garfield (December 5, 1899 \u2013 November 25, 1983) was an American anthropologist best known for her work on the social organization and plastic arts of the Tsimshian nation in British Columbia and Alaska. Viola Edmundson was born in Des Moines, Iowa.  Her family moved a few years later to Coupeville, Washington, on Whidbey Island, where she attended local schools. She enrolled at the University of Washington in Seattle beginning in 1919, transferring for financial reasons to what is now Western Washington University in Bellingham, where she became certified as a teacher.  She started a position in the 1920s teaching Tsimshian children in Metlakatla, Alaska, on Annette Island. This experience sparked her interest in Pacific Northwest Coast ethnology. While working at the Seattle Chamber of Commerce, she became the typist for Charles Garfield, an Alaskan former miner and fur trader.  They married in 1924. In 1927 Garfield re-enrolled at the University of Washington. She earned a B.A. in 1928 and an M.A. in anthropology in 1931, with a thesis on Tsimshian marriage patterns, based on fresh fieldwork in Metlakatla.  At the U.W. she studied under Erna Gunther. For her Ph.D. work (1931\u20131933), she transferred graduate courses she took at Columbia University in New York City with Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict. Through the early 1930s Garfield conducted immensely productive fieldwork in Lax Kw'alaams, B.C., or Port Simpson, as it was then known, the largest of the Canadian Tsimshian communities.  Her chief facilitator was William Beynon, the hereditary chief and a trained ethnographic fieldworker.  Their work in Port Simpson covered every facet of Tsimshian culture, including especially social structure\u2014this at the instigation of Boas, whose own Tsimshian monograph had been upstaged by Beynon and Marius Barbeau's published Tsimshian research.  She more than met Boas's expectations.  Her 1935 dissertation, published in 1939, was Tsimshian Clan and Society, still a masterful and eminently useful monograph. While in Port Simpson, Garfield was adopted into the Laxsgiik (Eagle clan) and given the Tsimshian name Diiks. Her later work focused on art and music. She also studied the Tlingit in Alaska, facilitated by her husband, who spoke Chinook Jargon. For decades until retirement she taught at the University of Washington. She never was promoted above the rank of Associate Professor or received tenure. She died in 1983. In 1984 a Festschrift in her honor was published by University of Washington Press, edited by Jay Miller and Carol M. Eastman.

He was a professor of Engineering Science at the California Institute of Technology. His research contribution included compressible fluid flow, free-streamline theory of cavities, jets and wakes, water waves and free-surface flows, mechanics of fish swimming and bird/insect flight, wind and ocean-current energy, and internal waves in the ocean. Wu came from a Chinese scholar family. His father had a degree in economics and finance, his mother graduated from high school and majored in literature, while his grandfather was a Chinese physician. During the Japanese invasion, the Japanese airplanes flying overhead eventually inspired him to enter aeronautics in the university. Wu received his BSc in 1946 from National Chiao Tung University in Shanghai (now Shanghai Jiao Tong University), and spent one year teaching upon graduation.[3] In January 1948 he arrived in the U.S. and enrolled at Iowa State University and graduated with an MS in December the same year.

Wu was involved in the research group headed by Paco Lagerstrom, where they developed further the asymptotic perturbation method pioneered by Ludwig Prandtl. Wu received his PhD in (1952), subsequently worked as a research fellow at Caltech for three years, and developed interest in water waves and hydrodynamics, due to inspiration from then Qian Xuesen and von Karman. After three years Wu became an assistant professor of applied mechanics (1955) at Caltech. In 1960, under the influence of G. I. Taylor and James Lighthill, Wu started to work on fish locomotion and bird flight (biofluiddynamics). During his time at Caltech he also contributed to the field of naval architecture and was involved in the International Towing Tank Conferences.

        "text": "Mailchimp is a marketing automation and email marketing platform. \"Mailchimp\" is the trade name of its operator, Rocket Science Group, an American company founded in 2001 by Ben Chestnut and Mark Armstrong, with Dan Kurzius joining at a later date. Mailchimp was launched in 2001.[5] The platform was named after one of their most popular e-greetings card characters, earning a few thousand dollars monthly.[6] Mailchimp began as a paid service and added a freemium option in 2009. Within a year, its user base had grown from 85,000 to 450,000.[7] By June 2014, it was sending over 10 billion emails per month on behalf of its users.[8] More than 600 million emails are sent through the platform every two days.[9] In August 2017, it was reported that Mailchimp would be opening offices in Brooklyn and Oakland, California.[10] In February 2019, Mailchimp acquired LemonStand, a smaller competitor.[11] Mailchimp later announced its plans to shift from mail distribution to offering a full marketing platform aimed at smaller organizations. This shift includes allowing customers to record and track customer leads within the platform, build landing pages and websites, and run ad retargeting advertisements on Facebook and Instagram.[12] As part of this, Mailchimp acquired the London based media and magazine company Courier Media in March 2020, with the stated goal of international growth. The magazine has a readership of 100,000 readers in more than 26 countries.[13] With founders Armstrong and Chestnut starting the company without outside funding or plans to go public, and never bringing on any outside investors thereafter, Mailchimp is considered an example of a successfully bootstrapped startup.[14][15][16] After turning down repeated acquisition offers for 20 years, Bloomberg reported on August 31, 2021, that Mailchimp was talking with Intuit about being acquired.[17] On September 13, 2021, Intuit confirmed it would acquire Mailchimp for approximately $12 billion in cash and stock.[18][19] On November 1, 2021, Intuit officially completed the acquisition for $5.7bn in cash, $6.3bn in common stock, and 573,000 restricted stock units. After the acquisition, Intuit changed the name of the platform to Intuit Mailchimp.[18][20] As a podcast advertiser, Mailchimp sponsored the launch of Serial, a podcast exploring a murder case over multiple episodes.[21] Another ad became memorable for its inclusion of an unscripted mispronunciation of the company's name \u2013 \"MailKimp\" \u2013 as spoken by a 14-year-old girl from Norway waiting in line for an iPhone 6.[22][23] The ad was parodied and \"MailKimp\" became a meme.[24][25] In response, Mailchimp bought the domain name mailkimp.com and redirected traffic to mailchimp.com.[23] In 2018, Mailchimp underwent a brand redesign to help visually demonstrate an evolution from an email marketing tool to a larger marketing platform. This redesign included an updated logo, color palette, typeface, new imagery, and illustrations. It updated the Mailchimp wordmark to \"Mailchimp\" rather than \"MailChimp\" with an uppercase letter \"C\".[26] In February 2016, Mailchimp announced it was merging Mandrill transactional email service into Mailchimp as an add-on feature and gave customers 60 days' notice to switch to the new pricing structure or find an alternative service platform.[27] The new pricing structure required a paid Mailchimp plan before being able to purchase Mandrill credits, resulting in customers paying for two products to access Mandrill.[28] Previously, customers were able to purchase Mandrill credits for sending emails without signing up on Mailchimp. The credits were originally priced at $9.95 for 25,000 emails but increased to $20 for the same number of emails under the new pricing scheme. In addition to needing to purchase Mandrill credits, customers now need to be on a paid Mailchimp monthly plan (the minimum monthly plan being $10 a month), even if the customer has no need for Mailchimp services and only wants access to Mandrill. Mandrill was later renamed Mailchimp Transactional.[29] In March 2022, Mailchimp suffered a data breach whereby intruders gained access to the data of 319 of their customers through social engineering. The exposed data includes email address, IP address, and the approximate location of their mailing list recipients.[30][31] A second data breach happened on January 11, 2024 when unauthorized actors gained access to an internal tool used by MailChimp customer support and account administration. The access was obtained through a social engineering attack on Mailchimp employees and contractors.  The attackers compromised employee credentials and used them to access 133 Mailchimp accounts. The exposed data potentially included names, email addresses, and campaign information. Mailchimp has not confirmed this data breach and is still investigating the incident and assessing the full impact.[32][33][34][needs update]",

        "text": "Rudolf the Black Cat (Japanese: \u30eb\u30c9\u30eb\u30d5\u3068\u30a4\u30c3\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u30c3\u30c6\u30ca, Hepburn: Rudorufu to Ippaiattena) is a 2016 Japanese animated family adventure drama film directed by Kunihiko Yuyama and Motonori Sakakibara.[1] It was released in Japan by Toho on August 6, 2016.[3] Rudolf, a domestic black cat from the Japanese town of Gifu (a city known for its cable cars and castles) never left his home, being cared for by the child Rie, his owner. When Rie's mother asks her to take food to his grandmother, Rudolf follows Rie out of the house. Rudolf eventually runs afoul of a fishmonger, runs away, gets inside a truck, and is knocked out by a broom the fishmonger threw. When Rudolf wakes up and gets out from the truck, he meets \"Gottalot\", a big street cat who lets Rudolf sleep under a temple. The next morning, the two traverse the town until Rudolph asks if Gottalot was a pet cat. Gottalot leaves in a huff. Rudolf then encounters Buchi, a cat with a habit of imitating martial arts moves, who says that Gottalot was known as the Junk Tiger. Buchi also mentions Devil, a dangerous dog. While offering to let Rudolf hang around his house, Buchi explains Gottalot's fight against a Doberman, who threatens to tear his ear off if he returns. Buchi cuts the story short when he sees a Siamese cat and goes after her. Later, after learning that Rudolf knows about his past, Gottalot explains that next to Devil's house is where his owner used to live until he went to the United States, leaving him. Ever since Gottalot became a stray, Devil looked down on him. After meeting up with Buchi, Gottalot and Rudolf infiltrate the school and enter a classroom, where Rudolf and Buchi become intrigued with the books. Gottalot and Buchi encourage Rudolf to learn to read and write. Days go by as Rudolf learn to read, and write. One day, Rudolf sees Gifu on a television screen. Despite knowing that Gifu is over a hundred miles away, Rudolf decides to find a way to get home, by going into a truck heading for Gifu. However, what he enters is a freezer truck. Gottalot and Buchi chase after the truck and retrieve Rudolf (frozen in a small block of ice) and free him. Autumn comes, and when a poster about a tour bus to Gifu, Rudolf and Gottalot ask Buchi, who becomes enticed to Misha, a Scottish Fold Cat who mentions that the bus will come at November 10 on 6:30 AM. Later in the day, Gottalot is injured by Devil. So, Rudolf tells Buchi to watch over Gottalot as he alerts the schoolteacher and leads him to Gottalot, the teacher brings the injured Gottalot to a doctor for medical attention. The schoolteacher eventually tells the cats that Gottalot will stay with him as he will need to rest for two weeks. In the Schoolteacher's house, Gottalot apologizes for making Rudolf worry, as Rudolf thanks him for watching over him as he says goodbye. Rudolf then faces Devil in a fight and despite Devil having the home advantage, Rudolf (with Buchi's fake out) beats Devil. But since Devil can't swim, he asks for help. Rudolf and Buchi then make him swear that he won't bully any cat ever again, to which Devil agrees to. Rudolf returns to Gottalot, who says that the tour bus left, so he won't be going back to Gifu. as the month's pass, Gottalot is fully recovered but isn't coming outside much. At spring, Buchi and Misha are dating, and Devil calmed down after their fight and explained that before Gottalot's owner moved away, Gottalot and Devil were good friends, but they broke off when Gottalot became a stray. Devil then has Rudolf give his food to Gottalot as a token of his apology. Later, Gottalot then helps Rudolf learn about the license plates of cars, signifying where they come from, along with Chinese text. One night, Gottalot explains that he'll be going to the United States, shocking everyone, since Gottalot's owner isn't going to return to his house as it is being remodeled. The next day, Rudolf says goodbye to Gottalot, Buchi, and Misha as the Truck he is currently aboard goes to different prefectures, by going from one truck to the next. but despite one of the trucks getting a flat tire, he manages to get home, but, when he enters the house, to his surprise, he discovers another black kitten who happens to be Rudolf's younger brother, who lived in the house a year after Rudolf was gone. knowing that the family can't have more than one cat, Rudolf leaves and returns to Tokyo. upon returning to Tokyo, Rudolf sees Buchi and Misha and says that he decided to stay in Tokyo. Then he sees Gottalot, who said that he was going, but his former owner returned who made a lot of money in America after selling his business. Later at night, Gottalot, Buchi, Misha, and Rudolf (who is renamed Crow) along with a few stray cats eat dinner. They also learn that Devil can swim. As the other cats enjoy themselves, Gottalot and Crow look at the night sky looking forward to the future. The film was 5th placed at the box office on its opening weekend in Japan, with 147,179 admissions and a gross of \u00a5187.3 million.[4][5] By its second weekend it had grossed US$6.6 million[6] and by its third weekend, US$10.2 million.[7]",

In early 1994, a port of the original Joust for the Atari Jaguar was showcased on few print publications such as Electronic Gaming Monthly and it was intended to be a hidden easter egg on an upcoming title for the console.[6][7][8] On September of the same year, both Atari Corporation and Williams Entertainment announced their partnership that included plans to update and release some of the latter's early arcade games for the Jaguar such as Defender, Joust and Robotron, while Atari Corp. handled the publishing of these titles respectively.[4][5] Later on during the same time period, it was planned for a Q2 1995 release, now under its finalized name.[9] Six months later, the game alongside Mortal Kombat III was announced for Jaguar as a result of their partnership. The game was said to be still under development, with ex-Atari Corporation vice-president in third-party development Bill Rehbock stating several of its planned features such as being played from a first-person perspective in a 3D environment.[10][11][12][13] During this period, only a few in-game screenshots of the project were showcased on magazines such as Ultimate Future Games and Edge respectively (which also mentioned it as an Atari Jaguar CD title),[2][14][15] while it was still listed for a Q2 1995 release.[16] Later in the year, Dactyl Joust was now planned for a November/Q4 1995 launch date, while internal documents from Atari also revealed that High Voltage Software were responsible for the development of the project.[3][17][18][19] An anonymous High Voltage Software employee recounted its development process in a post at Slashdot after being cancelled, stating several of the techniques and features in the game.[8] Scott Corley, main programmer and one of the designers of Ruiner Pinball at High Voltage, recounted more about the development process of the title for the system in a thread at the 3DO Zone forums in July 2014.[20] Scott stated that translating the original mechanics into 3D and make it intuitive to play proved to be the most difficult process during development, in addition of obtaining an optimal performance when developing on the Jaguar.[20] Despite internal documents from Atari still listing Dactyl Joust as still in development as of December 1995,[21] High Voltage stopped receiving payment from the former for the development of the project in the middle of 1995, leading the latter to believe it was being abandoned.[19] In an email exchange with website CyberRoach, a former programmer of the project stated that it was playable, while both artwork and a preliminary cover art are also rumored to exist.[8] In 2003, a short video clip of the game was showcased to the public by Carl Forhan of Songbird Productions and HVS CCO Eric Nofsinger.[22]",

        "text": "In psychology, the Wason selection task (or four-card problem) is a logic puzzle devised by Peter Cathcart Wason in 1966.[1][2][3] It is one of the most famous tasks in the study of deductive reasoning.[4] An example of the puzzle is: You are shown a set of four cards placed on a table, each of which has a number on one side and a color on the other. The visible faces of the cards show 3, 8, blue and red. Which card(s) must you turn over in order to test that if a card shows an even number on one face, then its opposite face is blue? A response that identifies a card that need not be inverted, or that fails to identify a card that needs to be inverted, is incorrect. The original task dealt with numbers (even, odd) and letters (vowels, consonants). The test is of special interest because people have a hard time solving it in most scenarios but can usually solve it correctly in certain contexts. In particular, researchers have found that the puzzle is readily solved when the imagined context is policing a social rule. The correct response is to turn over the 8 card and the red card. The rule was \"If the card shows an even number on one face, then its opposite face is blue.\" Only a card with both an even number on one face and something other than blue on the other face can invalidate this rule: The interpretation of \"if\" here is that of the material conditional in classical logic, so this problem can be solved by choosing the cards using modus ponens (all even cards must be checked to ensure they are blue) and modus tollens (all non-blue cards must be checked to ensure they are non-even). One experiment revolving around the Wason four card problem found many influences on people's selection in this task experiment that were not based on logic. The non-logical inferences made by the participants from this experiment demonstrate the possibility and structure of extra-logical reasoning mechanisms.[5] Alternatively, one might solve the problem by using another reference to zeroth-order logic. In classical propositional logic, the material conditional is false if and only if its antecedent is true and its consequent is false. As an implication of this, two cases need to be inspected in the selection task to check whether we are dealing with a false conditional: In Wason's study, not even 10% of subjects found the correct solution, which for the specific criteria of this problem, would be 8 card and the red card.[6] This result was replicated in 1993.[7] The poor success rate of this selection experiment may be explained by its lack of relevant significance. If this task was reframed, however, empirical evidence has shown an increase in logical responses.[8] Some authors have argued that participants do not read \"if... then...\" as the material conditional, since the natural language conditional is not the material conditional.[9][10][11] (See also the paradoxes of the material conditional for more information.)  However one interesting feature of the task is how participants react when the classical logic solution is explained: A psychologist, not very well disposed toward logic, once confessed to me that despite all problems in short-term inferences like the Wason Card Task, there was also the undeniable fact that he had never met an experimental subject who did not understand the logical solution when it was explained to him, and then agreed that it was correct.[12] Wason also ascribes participants' errors on this selection task due to confirmation bias. Confirmation bias compels people to seek the cards which confirm the rule; meanwhile, they overlook the main purpose of the experiment, which is to purposefully choose the cards that potentially disconfirm the rule.[13] As of 1983, experimenters had identified that success on the Wason selection task was highly context-dependent, but there was no theoretical explanation for which contexts elicited mostly correct responses and which ones elicited mostly incorrect responses.[14] Evolutionary psychologists Leda Cosmides and John Tooby (1992) identified that the selection task tends to produce the \"correct\" response when presented in a context of social relations.[14] For example, if the rule used is \"If you are drinking alcohol, then you must be over 18\" or in other words \"If you are not over 18, then you must not drink alcohol\", and the cards have an age on one side and beverage on the other, e.g., \"16\", \"drinking beer\", \"25\", \"drinking soda\", most people have no difficulty in selecting the correct cards (\"16\u201d and \"drinking beer\").[14] In a series of experiments in different contexts, subjects demonstrated consistent superior performance when asked to police a social rule involving a benefit that was only legitimately available to someone who had qualified for that benefit.[14] Cosmides and Tooby argued that experimenters have ruled out alternative explanations, such as that people learn the rules of social exchange through practice and find it easier to apply these familiar rules than less-familiar rules.[14] According to Cosmides and Tooby, this experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that a Wason task proves to be easier if the rule to be tested is one of social exchange (in order to receive benefit X you need to fulfill condition Y) and the subject is asked to police the rule, but is more difficult otherwise. They argued that such a distinction, if empirically borne out, would support the contention of evolutionary psychologists that human reasoning is governed by context-sensitive mechanisms that have evolved, through natural selection, to solve specific problems of social interaction, rather than context-free, general-purpose mechanisms.[14] In this case, the module is described as a specialized cheater-detection module.[14] Davies et al. (1995) have argued that Cosmides and Tooby's argument in favor of context-sensitive, domain-specific reasoning mechanisms as opposed to general-purpose reasoning mechanisms is theoretically incoherent and inferentially unjustified.[15] Von Sydow (2006) has argued that we have to distinguish deontic and descriptive conditionals, but that the logic of testing deontic conditionals is more systematic (see Beller, 2001) and depend on one's goals (see Sperber & Girotto, 2002).[11][16][17] However, in response to Kanazawa (2010),[18] Kaufman et al. (2011) gave 112 subjects a 70-item computerized version of the contextualized Wason card-selection task proposed by Cosmides and Tooby (1992) and found instead that \"performance on non-arbitrary, evolutionarily familiar problems is more strongly related to general intelligence than performance on arbitrary, evolutionarily novel problems\",[19] and writing for Psychology Today, Kaufman concluded instead that \"It seems that general intelligence is very much compatible with evolutionary psychology.\"[20]",

        "text": "The Silmi-mossi or Silmimoos\u00e9, Silmi-moos\u00e9, are a people of Burkina Faso of mixed Mossi and Fulani origin. They are historically based in the Yatenga in the north and speak in Moore language. They are attached to the Mossi with whom they share the same culture and constitute a Mossi sub group. The Sankaras come from a Fulani-Mossis lineage also called the Silmimoose. Fulanis and Mossis today represent the most important cultural groups in Burkina Faso, respectively 10% and 52%, and the most mobile. The Fulanis being breeders and the Mossis farmers, their meeting was natural. \"The Silmiisi met the Moose on the Moogo territory in the 15th century. The routes of their fortune have sometimes crossed on the same territory as inhabitants, through battlefields as campaign allies of a time, or as enemies in other circumstances. In any case, the needs of men through the imperatives of politics, the economy and nature have cut the spaces for farmers and the paths for breeders. On this soil plowed by peasant tools and dug by the hooves of horses and oxen, the Moose and the Silmiisi forged relationships, tied alliances, poured and shared their blood. The Silmimoose were born then, sons of history, from the need to exchange between lineages and societies. The meeting between farmers and breeders gave birth to farmers-breeders.[1] The Silmi-Mossi are a very interesting mixed race found in the circles of Ouahigouya and Ouagadougou. Mixed races are not rare in West Africa: the Toucouleurs of Fouta-Toro, the Foulahs of Fouta-Djallon, the Ouassoulonk\u00e9s, the Foulank\u00e9s, the Khassonk\u00e9s, are mixed races composed of fulanis and 'Negroes', fulani and Sereres (or wolofs) for the Toucouleurs, fulani and Mand\u00e9s (mainly Malinkes) for the other races.[2] But it will be noticed that all these mixed races are located west of the Niger Loop. In the Niger loop itself, where the Voltaic (Mole-dagbon...) races are, there has been little mixing of fulanis with other ethnic groups. The Silmi-Mossi, a mixture of fulanis and Mossis, are the only mixed race known on this side and they are still very few and little known. The word Silmi-Mossi means \"Fulani-Mossi\" in Mossi language, from Silmiiga (pl.Silmiisi) which means fulani, foulbe; and of Moaaga (at pl. Moos\u00e9) which naturally designates the Mossi. We should therefore say exactly a Silmi-moaaga in the singular, the Silmisi-Moos\u00e9 in the plural, but, by abbreviation, the Mossis say a Silmi-moaaga, Silmi-Mossi.[3] The 1904 Monograph says about their origin: \"Next to the Foulb\u00e9s we must also place the Silmi-moose came to the Yatenga 70 years ago and who come from the crossing of a fulani with a Mossi about 150 years ago [so in 1753] a Fittob of 'Bahn,' from the family of the current leader Demba Sidiki, wanted to settle in the region of T\u00e9ma, today circle of Ouagadougou. His wife having died without leaving children, this Fulani obtained with a few oxen a mossi woman, daughter of the chief of T\u00e9ma, from whom he had several children thus forming the strain of the Silmi-Mossis[4] For his part, Vadier said: \"Around 1780, under the reign of the fittob\u00e9  fulani chief Hamat Diam, living in Bahn, a fulani named Pab\u00e9 left the Bahn region alone to graze his herd in the region of T\u00e9ma (circle of Ouagadougou). He married the daughter of the chief of this province who was of the Mossi race (this woman was called Siboudou) and with a fulani woman from Ouagadougou. Pab\u00e9 settled in T\u00e9ma, had no children from his fulani wife  but his mossi wife gave him five sons and a daughter. The sons were called Mali, Koumbas\u00e9, Garba, Fa\u00e9n\u00e9, Sambo, the daughter Sadia.The girl married a Mossi from Gourki, north of T\u00e9ma, but had no offspring. Pab\u00e9 and his sons returned to Kalsaka (Yatenga), 60 kilometers southeast of Ouahigouya where they did both livestock and crops. Pab\u00e9 leaving his children in Kalsaka came to die in Bane.[5] Garba and his brothers, fearing that they could not be received by their father's family and having mossi blood in their veins, remained in Kalsaka where they married Mossi women. The descendants then united with Mossis, but never with Fulanis. Becoming numerous, the Silmi-Mossis had to leave Kalsaka in part. Some settled in B\u00e9ma, B\u00e9renga, Rima, Tougo, L\u00e9benga, then extended on the circle of Ouagadougou to T\u00e9ma, Yako, etc. \"Ultimately, the Silmi-Mossi come from a mixture of fulani (Fittob\u00e9s) and Mossis. The physiological type is rather mossi than fulani and in this mixture the Mossis seem to win.Their culture is similar to that of moaaga, and the typical chiefdom of the Moose. They speak the moore like the Mossi.[6] The Silmi-Mossi occupy in the Yatenga the basin of the southern part of the White Volta, from about Tougouya to B\u00e9renga. Once there, at the junction of the marigot de Todiam and the marigot de Niess\u00e9ga which together form the Volta Blanche as found in the circle of Ouagadougou, they follow, to the north, the valley of the marigot de Niess\u00e9ga from Rodoma and B\u00e9ma to the east to Tarba and Kountigh\u00e9 to the west. These are the Silmi-Mossi from the regions of Tougouya, Koukabako, Kalsaka, Rodoma, Tongo and Goursi[7] In addition, some Silmi-Mossis settled further north, in the thalweg of the marigot de Todiam, among the Foulb\u00e9s Toromb\u00e9s from Bassanga to Titao and others even grew in the north of the circle to Ko\u00f9mban\u00e9, Damdoll\u00e9 and Pogoro.[7] Ultimately, the Silmi-Mossi are mainly established in the southeast of the Yatenga, without having penetrated the large cantons of the extreme southeast (Koussouka, Zitenga and Riziam).[7] They form 45 villages (or village districts, because they are often established in a Mossi village where they form a separate neighborhood). As there are exactly 5,627 (according to my March 1915 census), that makes 125 people per village (or neighborhood) on average. We therefore see that the Silmi-Mossi form small establishments, a trend that is even more characterized and more accentuated in the pure Peuls.[7] The Silmi-Mossis of Yatenga are both farmers and herders.Theirs family names are Sankara, Sinar\u00e9, Zida, Band\u00e9, Kabor\u00e9...",

In the Niger loop itself, where the Voltaic (Mole-dagbon...) races are, there has been little mixing of fulanis with other ethnic groups. The Silmi-Mossi, a mixture of fulanis and Mossis, are the only mixed race known on this side and they are still very few and little known. The word Silmi-Mossi means \"Fulani-Mossi\" in Mossi language, from Silmiiga (pl.Silmiisi) which means fulani, foulbe; and of Moaaga (at pl. Moos\u00e9) which naturally designates the Mossi. We should therefore say exactly a Silmi-moaaga in the singular, the Silmisi-Moos\u00e9 in the plural, but, by abbreviation, the Mossis say a Silmi-moaaga, Silmi-Mossi.[3] The 1904 Monograph says about their origin: \"Next to the Foulb\u00e9s we must also place the Silmi-moose came to the Yatenga 70 years ago and who come from the crossing of a fulani with a Mossi about 150 years ago [so in 1753] a Fittob of 'Bahn,' from the family of the current leader Demba Sidiki, wanted to settle in the region of T\u00e9ma, today circle of Ouagadougou. His wife having died without leaving children, this Fulani obtained with a few oxen a mossi woman, daughter of the chief of T\u00e9ma, from whom he had several children thus forming the strain of the Silmi-Mossis[4] For his part, Vadier said: \"Around 1780, under the reign of the fittob\u00e9 fulani chief Hamat Diam, living in Bahn, a fulani named Pab\u00e9 left the Bahn region alone to graze his herd in the region of T\u00e9ma (circle of Ouagadougou). He married the daughter of the chief"

He married the daughter of the chief of this province who was of the Mossi race (this woman was called Siboudou) and with a fulani woman from Ouagadougou. Pab\u00e9 settled in T\u00e9ma, had no children from his fulani wife but his mossi wife gave him five sons and a daughter. The sons were called Mali, Koumbas\u00e9, Garba, Fa\u00e9n\u00e9, Sambo, the daughter Sadia.The girl married a Mossi from Gourki, north of T\u00e9ma, but had no offspring. Pab\u00e9 and his sons returned to Kalsaka (Yatenga), 60 kilometers southeast of Ouahigouya where they did both livestock and crops. Pab\u00e9 leaving his children in Kalsaka came to die in Bane.[5] Garba and his brothers, fearing that they could not be received by their father's family and having mossi blood in their veins, remained in Kalsaka where they married Mossi women. The descendants then united with Mossis, but never with Fulanis. Becoming numerous, the Silmi-Mossis had to leave Kalsaka in part. Some settled in B\u00e9ma, B\u00e9renga, Rima, Tougo, L\u00e9benga, then extended on the circle of Ouagadougou to T\u00e9ma, Yako, etc. \"Ultimately, the Silmi-Mossi come from a mixture of fulani (Fittob\u00e9s) and Mossis. The physiological type is rather mossi than fulani and in this mixture the Mossis seem to win.Their culture is similar to that of moaaga, and the typical chiefdom of the Moose. They speak the moore like the Mossi.[6] The Silmi-Mossi occupy in the Yatenga the basin of the southern part of the White Volta, from about Tougouya to B\u00e9renga.

Once there, at the junction of the marigot de Todiam and the marigot de Niess\u00e9ga which together form the Volta Blanche as found in the circle of Ouagadougou, they follow, to the north, the valley of the marigot de Niess\u00e9ga from Rodoma and B\u00e9ma to the east to Tarba and Kountigh\u00e9 to the west. These are the Silmi-Mossi from the regions of Tougouya, Koukabako, Kalsaka, Rodoma, Tongo and Goursi[7] In addition, some Silmi-Mossis settled further north, in the thalweg of the marigot de Todiam, among the Foulb\u00e9s Toromb\u00e9s from Bassanga to Titao and others even grew in the north of the circle to Ko\u00f9mban\u00e9, Damdoll\u00e9 and Pogoro.[7] Ultimately, the Silmi-Mossi are mainly established in the southeast of the Yatenga, without having penetrated the large cantons of the extreme southeast (Koussouka, Zitenga and Riziam).[7] They form 45 villages (or village districts, because they are often established in a Mossi village where they form a separate neighborhood). As there are exactly 5,627 (according to my March 1915 census), that makes 125 people per village (or neighborhood) on average. We therefore see that the Silmi-Mossi form small establishments, a trend that is even more characterized and more accentuated in the pure Peuls.[7] The Silmi-Mossis of Yatenga are both farmers and herders.Theirs family names are Sankara, Sinar\u00e9, Zida, Band\u00e9, Kabor\u00e9..."

        "text": "Steve Robinson (born September 7, 1946) is an American radio manager, producer and executive producer. He has held senior management positions with numerous American radio stations, including WFMT and the WFMT Radio Network/Chicago, WCRB/Boston, and public radio outlets WBUR/Boston, WGBH/Boston, KPFA/Berkeley, WBGO/Newark, Vermont Public Radio and Nebraska Public Radio Network. Robinson served as general manager of the statewide Nebraska Public Radio Network (1990\u20132000) and WFMT and the WFMT Radio Network from 2000 until October 2016.[1][2] A 50-year radio veteran, he has produced programs ranging from classical music documentaries[3] to public affairs programs[4] and has directed over 100 on-air pledge drives.[5] He was born in Boston in 1946. He completed graduation from Boston University in 1969 with a degree in music education. Robinson started his professional career in 1967 at WBUR/Boston while still an undergraduate at Boston University. At WBUR, he produced and hosted six two-hour classical music programs per week. He also created and co-hosted a Saturday morning live call-in program about high fidelity called Shop Talk which ran from 1968 to 1978.[6] After WBUR, Robinson held positions at WGBH and WCRB/Boston and KPFA/Berkeley. In 1976 he was appointed the first development director of Vermont Public Radio (VPR). At VPR, he won a national award from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) for \"The Sky Report with Professor Delo Mook\", a five-minute daily program about astrophysics that was syndicated throughout the U.S. CPB cited the program for \"innovative idea and superb execution.\" In 1980, he became the first development director for the newly created Jazz station, WBGO/Jazz88 in Newark. At WBGO, Robinson helped establish the station as one of the most important Jazz stations in the U.S.[7] In 1971, Robinson met multi-reed instrumentalist, Rahsaan Roland Kirk, and worked with him on several projects, including Radio Free Rahsaan, an eight-part series of one-hour radio programs.[8] After Mr. Kirk's untimely passing in 1977, he produced Memories of Rahsaan, a series of 30-minute programs that became part of Radio Free Rahsaan.[9] In 1984, he co-founded AIR, the Association of Independents in Radio, a service organization to assist independent radio producers in the United States.[10] Robinson wrote AIR's first two successful grants from the New York State Council on the Arts and the National Endowment for the Arts.[11] In 1990, Robinson became the general manager of the newly formed Nebraska Public Radio Network (NPRN), a nine-station system of transmitters throughout the state that reached over one million listeners.[12] Throughout his career, Robinson has produced dozens of radio programs that have been heard throughout the world, including live broadcasts from Salzburg, Austria (on the occasion of Mozart's 250th birthday); Durbin, South Africa (for the world premiere for the opera, \"Princess Magogo); Quebec City, Canada (for a live broadcast of Mahler's Symphony of a Thousand with 1000 performers); Jerusalem, Israel (for a broadcast from the Jerusalem International Chamber Music Festival); and has produced numerous live broadcasts from Chicago and throughout the U.S.[13] He has worked with William Schuman, Elliott Carter,[14] Charles Dodge,[15] Roger Reynolds, Alan Hovhaness[16] and other composers on programs about their music. In 2003, he created the daily classical music appreciation radio program, Exploring Music with Bill McGlaughlin. The series is carried by state networks throughout the world including Australia and China.[17] At the WFMT Radio Network he created the first classical music radio exchange between the United States and China.[18] In 2000, Robinson became the general manager of WFMT and the WFMT Radio Network. Founded in 1951, WFMT is considered as one of the most admired classical music stations in the U.S. and under his leadership many new programs were added to the local schedule, including Introductions, Impromptu and others. Robinson worked on diversifying the programs of WFMT by expanding the amount of live broadcasting from the station.[19] One of his most important initiatives at the WFMT Radio Network was the creation of Exploring Music with Bill McGlaughlin, in 2003. This daily, one-hour music appreciation program is heard on over 60 U.S. stations and has a weekly audience of over 400,000 unique listeners.[20] The program is also heard in Australia, Guam, the Philippines and in Beijing. Initial funding for Exploring Music was provided by the National Endowment for the Arts with additional funding from individuals and foundations.[21] The station under his leadership focused on live music by broadcasting a wide array of local Chicago groups and ensembles. In 2007, the Chicago Tribune named him \"Chicagoan of the Year\" in the arts.[22] In 2015, he executed a cross-cultural broadcast relationship between America and China by exporting to China for the first time broadcasting concerts by the NY Philharmonic, LA Philharmonic, San Francisco Symphony, Dallas Symphony, Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall.[23] He also arranged for concerts from the Shanghai Spring International Music Festival[24] and the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra to be exported to the West with broadcasts in the U.S., Canada and Europe.[25] In 2022, Robinson launched a YouTube channel for his series, The Architects of Music with Lawrence Rapchak. In 2004 and again in 2010, Robinson created and produced two, live, 17-hour fundraising campaigns involving all Chicago radio and TV stations to aid victims of the tsunami in southeast and the earthquake in Haiti.[26] Each campaign raised over $3 million. Robinson received two Wesbury Award from the American Red Cross of Greater Chicago for the fundraising campaigns.[27][28] In 2008, Robinson and Bill McGlaughlin received the Dushkin Award for Exploring Music with Bill McGlaughlin from the Music Institute of Chicago.[29][30] He has received local and national awards for his work in Chicago, including the Champion Award from the Merit School of Music, the ASCAP/Deems Taylor Award for creative programming and others.[31]",
